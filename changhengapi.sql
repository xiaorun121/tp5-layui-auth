To accept the gamer chair is to accept the implication of Dorito dust. To <em>know</em> the gamer chair is to let your pantsless butt sit on it for a long time. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I can’t tell you anything new about gaming chairs—they are still gaudy and expensive—but I have been sitting my butt on the <em>Fortnite </em>Battle Bus edition of the Secretlab Titan Evo 2022 Series for a while now, and I can tell you that, honestly, it gets the job done<br></p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h77929\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>The <em>Fortnite </em>part</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">First we need to address the Battle Bus in the room. I don’t play <em>Fortnite</em>, but when Secretlab asked me if I wanted to review its latest special edition Titan, I thought it could be funny. For whom? I’m not sure.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">For me, I guess. It’s just the <em>Fortnite</em> Battle Bus gamer chair. It’s magical. It feels like the <em>Fortnite </em>Battle Bus chair could be the egg MrBeast was born from, emerging as a fully grown adult, smiling with his menacing <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.svg.com/img/gallery/mrbeast-and-gordon-ramsays-collab-has-fans-going-wild/l-intro-1654017060.jpg\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.svg.com/img/gallery/mrbeast-and-gordon-ramsays-collab-has-fans-going-wild/l-intro-1654017060.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mouthful of gamer teeth</a></span>.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s a conversation piece. When people see my <em>Fortnite</em> chair, they ask, “is that a <em>Fortnite</em> chair?” And, you know what, it is. On its front, it has turquoise embroidery that says FORTNITE. This is so everyone can understand that this mostly normal-looking chair is actually a <em>Fortnite</em> chair. Some of the chair’s accessories came in <em>Fortnite</em>-themed boxes, too, but, overall, it’s a normal chair that says FORTNITE on it. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"df91549f087be360fed976167c085633\" data-recommend-id=\"image://df91549f087be360fed976167c085633\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A woman holds a blue Secretlab box.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"df91549f087be360fed976167c085633\" data-recommend-id=\"image://df91549f087be360fed976167c085633\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A woman holds a blue Secretlab box.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I had hoped, though, that the <em>Fortnite</em> Battle Bus chair would look more like a Battle Bus seat so I could finally combine my love of gaming, public transportation, and hot air balloon technology. Alas, the <em>Fortnite</em> chair only displays an embroidered image of the Battle Bus on its back. You have to gaze into its sunset-pink threads to envision yourself floating away on the airborne Battle Bus—your butt will never know such a sensation.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h77930\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Setting up the chair</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The <em>Fortnite</em> gamer chair, in a massive cardboard box that I and a few friends could use as a makeshift Noah’s ark, was delivered August 22. That’s three weeks of sitting time for those of you keeping track.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This particular edition of the Secretlab Titan Evo 2022 is available for pre-order directly from the Secretlab site at $624 for small and regular sizes, the latter of which is recommended for people up to 6’2” and under 220 pounds, and $674 for the extra-large size, which is recommended for people up to 6’9” and 395 pounds. This size inclusivity is appreciated and a staple of Secretlab chairs—in a 2017 review of the Titan, big guy and <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/mike-fahey-kotaku-eulogy-obituary-senior-reporter-1849501728\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/mike-fahey-kotaku-eulogy-obituary-senior-reporter-1849501728\"><em>Kotaku</em> staffer Mike Fahey</a></span> wrote that the chair was a “fine place to spend hours on your copious end.”<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Immediately after the big box was delivered, my <em>League of Legends</em> boyfriend and I started putting the chair together. Overall, the process was simple and easily explained by the massive, poster-sized instruction sheet that came with it, but the chair is pretty heavy, and you will need a buddy if you are pea-sized and weak like me. The box comes with strips of thin foam to place heavy pieces on and make moving easier, though, which is helpful. All told, setting up the <em>Fortnite</em> chair took about 50 sweaty minutes.<br></p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"a20a1adf5d623fd14de4fe799c5b8aa0\" data-recommend-id=\"image://a20a1adf5d623fd14de4fe799c5b8aa0\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3023\" data-height=\"1701\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A man holds a large Secretlab instruction sheet.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"a20a1adf5d623fd14de4fe799c5b8aa0\" data-recommend-id=\"image://a20a1adf5d623fd14de4fe799c5b8aa0\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3023\" data-height=\"1701\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A man holds a large Secretlab instruction sheet.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h77931\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Sitting down in the chair</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I immediately started sitting down in the chair. Who wouldn’t? It’s a chair for <em>Fortnite</em>.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It has all the comfort-focused features of a standard Titan Evo 2022 chair, <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://secretlab.co/pages/titan-evo-2022-series\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://secretlab.co/pages/titan-evo-2022-series\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">which means</a></span> things like a proprietary <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://blog.secretlab.co/stories/secretlab-neo-hybrid-leatherette-vs-softweave-plus-fabric-which-should-you-choose/\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://blog.secretlab.co/stories/secretlab-neo-hybrid-leatherette-vs-softweave-plus-fabric-which-should-you-choose/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">synthetic leather</a></span>, seat curved for “ergonomic support,” and adjustable lumbar support. It is a stiff chair, which might take some getting used to if you’re used to seats with more cushioning or flexibility, but its stiffness ultimately makes it feel more supportive than cramped.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The headrest is a magnetic, detachable cushion. I like that you can place it near your head or your neck, as preferred. The magnet that holds it in place starts at the very tip of the chair and ends fairly low, so I can lounge comfortably against the cushion even though I’m technically too short for the regular-sized chair Secretlab sent me.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The doorway to my gaming room was too narrow to get the chunky <em>Fortnite </em>chair in there, so I ended up rotating it between my living room and dining room and adjusting the chair in different ways depending on what I was doing. Sitting in the chair for an extended period of time doing different things, like typing on my laptop, playing a console game, or eating at the table, never hurt my back or felt awkward.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">One impressive adjustment is how the chair allows you to go from sitting stick-straight to leaning almost completely flat on your back. During a Mets game viewing, my non-gamer friend Will sat in the gaming chair and reclined all the way back. It was the longest anyone had sat in the chair with the recline so extreme, and there were a few moments when I thought he would fall down and become concussed by the <em>Fortnite</em> chair. But “I feel safe,” he told me when I expressed concern. “I trust the chair.”<br></p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"d406f98b9e6ecd3cf3b5578cfe1b346d\" data-recommend-id=\"image://d406f98b9e6ecd3cf3b5578cfe1b346d\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Secretlab\'s Fortnite chair is positioned straight ahead.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"d406f98b9e6ecd3cf3b5578cfe1b346d\" data-recommend-id=\"image://d406f98b9e6ecd3cf3b5578cfe1b346d\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Secretlab\'s Fortnite chair is positioned straight ahead.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h77932\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Complaining about the chair</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The chair is supportive, kind, and loves <em>Fortnite</em>. These are qualities you really must admire. But, during the chair’s assembly, I was disappointed to remove some untouched pieces from their packages and find they already had dings on them. This was a review product, but if I had paid its hefty full price, I’d be frustrated by the pieces not being immaculate upon arrival. Likewise, though this chair is happy to provide you with battle royale-themed succor, I’m a nerd about fashion and the stitching on this chair, to me, looks fast and loose. Long, loose stitches mean that fabric is held less securely, making a garment or, in this case, a <em>Fortnite</em> chair, more susceptible to tearing or fraying. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"38b391e785af9109e6cdccdee8c4fa36\" data-recommend-id=\"image://38b391e785af9109e6cdccdee8c4fa36\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3024\" data-height=\"1701\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A Secretlab armrest displays signs of wear.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"38b391e785af9109e6cdccdee8c4fa36\" data-recommend-id=\"image://38b391e785af9109e6cdccdee8c4fa36\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3024\" data-height=\"1701\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A Secretlab armrest displays signs of wear.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This isn’t a complaint as much as it is a heads up—I was way too small for the standard chair at 5’4 and 120 pounds. I still enjoyed sitting in it, but sometimes I felt like a baby pretending to be the president, and often sat on it cross-legged or with both knees up. The armrests and chair height are not nearly as customizable as the back of the chair. They budge more than they transform. So if a chair isn’t in your suggested height and weight class, you might struggle in finding a perfect calibration, which is something you’re presumably looking for in dropping over 500 dollars on a chair.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This chair and its packaging was also not nearly as aggressively <em>Fortnite</em>-themed as I kind of wanted it to be, so if you’re a <em>Fortnite</em> superfan only interested in the chair for its collectibility, that is something to note, too. Secretlab also released three <em>Fortnite</em>-edition memory foam <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://secretlab.co/products/secretlab-fortnite-edition-lumbar-pillow\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://secretlab.co/products/secretlab-fortnite-edition-lumbar-pillow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“lumbar pillows”</a></span> fashioned after Peely, Llama, and Cuddle Team Leader, but you have to pre-order these separately for $59 each, and they currently ship two weeks later than the chair.

Be aware that making the chair a good match will depend on whether or not you get a size that reflects your needs, that the chair’s quality might not be exactly what you want for the price, and that its <em>Fortnite</em> theme is literally skin-deep. It’s a chair first, <em>Fortnite</em> experience second.

From the 80’s to early 2010’s, Sam (mother died in a car accident, Harvard math dropout, good in front of crowds), Sadie (doesn’t believe in marriage, MIT game design wunderkind, prone to working crunch hours), and, for a time, Marx (rich, handsome, Harvard-roommate-turned-game-producer) come together because of games. To them, playtime is personal, political, and the result of their dedicated, exacting work. Games require blood sacrifice—not sleeping enough, fighting too much—but in them, you can claim your little piece of immortality.<br></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Sam, whose leg was shattered in 27 places in the devastating car crash that killed his mother, turns to games to inhabit a body more steady than his own. Sadie, who got into games while her sister battled childhood cancer, likes losing herself in a better, safer world. And Marx just thinks games are fun.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But Zevin maps their disparate reasons for playing to their temperaments. At Unfair Games, the company conceived in their college apartment, Sam is fond of creating in-game facsimiles of himself, Sadie rages over the real world’s blindness to women developers, and Marx, again, likes having fun.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">To these characters, video games are a necessity indistinguishable from all of life’s other worthy pursuits, on par with or better than making lots of money and having sex. Zevin presents their devotion to the craft with gentle authority. By the end of my reading, some of which I spent a bit weepily, thinking about the friendships and games in my life, I felt that my belief in video games had been restored. I didn’t even know it needed restoration. But Zevin suggests that games are like relationships, in that way. They are things that could tap you on the shoulder when you’re busy being brooding and occupied, reminding you that everything and everyone  occasionally requires some TLC.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\"[]\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Tomorrow-novel-Gabrielle-Zevin/dp/0593321200/ref=sr_1_1?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/gabrielle-zevin-video-game-design-fiction-novel-review-1849442689&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\" data-amazonasin=\"0593321200\" data-amazontag=\"kinjakotakulink-20\"><em>Tomorrow</em></a></span>’s third-person omniscient narrator, whose storytelling flits across decades (“[Sadie] would never be much of a drinker,” the narrator informs us while Sadie is still in college), and in one particularly meta section, dives into a game, pronounces aphorisms about the overlap of play, life, and love like a Greek oracle in reverie.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 jXybyg align--left js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"62ad566bc94c5223a6fbef3094068837\" data-recommend-id=\"image://62ad566bc94c5223a6fbef3094068837\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1875\" data-height=\"2850\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The cover of Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" style=\"width:1875px\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"62ad566bc94c5223a6fbef3094068837\" data-recommend-id=\"image://62ad566bc94c5223a6fbef3094068837\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1875\" data-height=\"2850\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The cover of Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">“To play requires trust and love,” “A name is destiny, if you think it is,” “the human brain is every bit as closed a system as a Mac,” it predicts with delicious conviction. The title <em>Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow</em> on its own is a sort of bold divination, coming from a soliloquy in Marx’s beloved <em>Macbeth</em>. In the address, Macbeth dismisses life as “a tale / Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, / Signifying nothing.”<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">“What is a game?” Marx asks Sam and Sadie. “It’s[...]the possibility of infinite rebirth, infinite redemption. The idea that if you keep playing, you could win.”<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Though Marx and Sadie’s friendship eventually turns romantic, Sam and Sadie, the older, arguably, more important relationship (“There were so many people who could be your lover,” the narrator says, “but[...]there were relatively few people who could move you creatively”) never does. It, instead, alights and broils for three decades. They come together, pull apart, come together, pull apart. It’s not romantic, Sam and Sadie themselves say often, but it is devotion. Like trying to reach a high score or believing in a God. “He has made everything beautiful in its time,” says Ecclesiastes 3:11. “He has also set eternity in the human heart.”<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Despite its everlasting chastity, Sam and Sadie’s relationship reminded me of the time-spanning romances in the movies <em>The Way We Were </em>and <em>When Harry Met Sally</em>…, both of which, like <em>Tomorrow</em>, are more interested in the process of love than the kissing. Friendship is a form of art, a prayer. But, memorably, in <em>The Way We Were</em>, Barbra Streisand’s character pleads with Robert Redford, who is on the brink of leaving her and becoming nothing more than a friend.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">“Couldn’t we both win?” she asks him sincerely.<br></p>\n<aside class=\"sc-o6p93a-0 gJydMU\"><span class=\"sc-196v4ms-0 bpQblS\" contenteditable=\"false\"></span><span class=\"sc-a3cloy-0 bzNnZL\">“Despite any diminishing returns, humans don’t give up, we wait for something good to float down into our palms.”</span><span class=\"sc-196v4ms-0 bpQblS\" contenteditable=\"false\"></span></aside>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">No, we couldn’t. In Sadie’s childhood favorite game, <em>The Oregon Trail</em>, hunting more bison than you can eat allows their meat to spoil. For you to live in sensual excess, the bison must lose—Sadie feels bad about this. Sam, Sadie, and Marx all love each other from their heads to their toes, but when Sadie and Marx fall <em>in love</em> and buy a house, Sam feels that he’s some platonic love loser. Everyone wants to win. Everyone wants more. But Zevin finds comfort in everyday losses—in business, love, and death. Like Marx (and Shakespeare) says, despite any diminishing returns, humans don’t give up, we wait for something good to float down into our palms.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Zevin spends much of the novel ruminating on this contradiction. In games and in getting older, interpersonal drama and death become expected. Cheap. Still, you hold tight to the moments that lit you up, a week ago, ten years ago. Another game designer, at one point, tells Sam that she loves the way Sadie “does blood.”<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">“Maybe it’s my imagination,” she says, “but I feel like she has people bleeding slightly different colors[...]. It’s a small thing, [...]but I’m obsessed with it.”<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Likewise, Sadie’s anger with Sam always softens when she recognizes him as the child she met in her sister’s children’s hospital decades ago, or as the boy she ran into again at college, who lied about being able to see the hidden image in the <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://newyork.museumofillusions.us/magic-eye-can-you-see-it/\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://newyork.museumofillusions.us/magic-eye-can-you-see-it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Magic Eye posters</a></span> that beguiled the 90s.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">“<em>This is what time travel is,</em>” Sam thinks to himself during that college run-in. “It’s looking at a person, and seeing them in the present and the past, concurrently.”<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The only thing that gifts you immortality, apart from video games, <em>Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow</em> suggests, is hope.

Even nasty <em>Kotaku</em> commenters, who Zevin amusingly notes responded to Sam saying in an interview that “there is no more intimate act than play, even sex” with deciding “there must be something seriously wrong with Sam,” cannot tamper the internal motor that makes us want to live, again, again. This book, with its respect for craft—the craft of love and games, or loving games—will remind you of how abundant one life is, how lucky we are to keep each other in our memories forever. </p>\n<aside class=\"sc-1c7snby-0 gGJizi\"></aside>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"> <br></p>', '2024-01-10 16:32:01', '2024-01-10 16:32:01', 'Work, Life, And Sex All Revolve Around Video Games In This Devastating Fiction Book', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/44a7ced172b422ed02862bece7e30045.jpg', 'etc', 'https://kotaku.com/gabrielle-zevin-video-game-design-fiction-novel-review-1849442689', 'We will never find the Fountain of Youth people fantasized about centuries ago, ...', ''),

If you ever do receive such a heads-up, you’d be wise to heed it. I learned so while playing <em>Renaissance Faire</em>, a massively multiplayer real-world role-playing game that is only nominally about the Renaissance.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Rewind to 2019: Some friends and I were booting up <em>Renaissance Faire</em> for the first time (read: sitting on a bus, apocalyptically hungover, at 10:15 a.m. on a Saturday), discussing whether it’d be a blast or a bust. That’s when we met the most magical man I’ve ever seen in my life. A guy in a sleeveless tunic and leather bycocket, holding a Bud Light glistening with cool condensation in one hand. He turned to face us, and started explaining how <em>Renaissance Faire</em> can shift your perspective so subtly you don’t even register the change.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">“You’re hangin’ out, and you’re pounding mead, and your brain just, like, flips,” he said, rotating his empty hand in a motion that I think suggested a human brain doing a cartwheel. “You don’t really realize it. But your brain just flips, man.”</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">He was absolutely correct. I just didn’t know it at the time.</p>\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 khcaUW\">\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I recently gave <em>Renaissance Faire</em>, affectionately called <em>RenFaire</em> by diehard fans, another spin.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>RenFaire</em> draws heavily from an older game called <em>Renaissance, But Also Many Other Eras From Human History For Some Reason</em>. Blessedly, the more modern versions of <em>Renaissance Faire</em> have completely done away with most of what made <em>Renaissance, But Also Many Other Eras...</em> such a drag—the wars, the famine, the illness, the public executions, the chamber pots.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Since the latter half of the 20th century, <em>Renaissance Faire</em> has come out on an annual release schedule, though it was inadvisable to play last year due to an unprecedented number of bugs. Each subsequent version doesn’t iterate much on form. To you, that might sound like creative inertia for the express purpose of easy profit. To me, it suggests that <em>Renaissance Faire</em> has achieved true mastery of form: It’s confident in what it is, knows exactly what it wants to deliver, and then delivers on it reliably.</p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Renaissance Faire\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"renaissance-faire\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Renaissance Faire</em> sets you and thousands of other people in a makeshift village designed to look like a town (sorry, towne) from an indeterminate period of history. Your goal, ostensibly, is to steadfastly pretend like you live in that indeterminate period of history, but it’s most fun if you simply go with the flow. You can play various mini-games, you can hand over money to buy <em>stuff</em>, you can watch in-game concerts and performances. About two-thirds of attendees are dressed in their snazziest costumes and other optional cosmetic options. The rest are just there, in blue denim and pima cotton T-shirts, for shits and giggles (and turkey legs). They’ll come back next year in full costume.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Rocket League</em>, and other live-service games, <em>Renaissance Faire</em> features a hodgepodge of characters from across the spectrum of popular fiction. For instance, at the knife-throwing mini-game (which rules), you can see a cavalcade of <em>Genshin Impact</em> heroes. Over at the tests of strength (which also rule), you might see Link or Zelda smash a hammer into a metal thing that sends another metal thing up a third metal thing whereupon it then goes <em>claaaang</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s also a place where you can see one member of a fictional globe-spanning conspiracy assassinate another member of a <em>different</em> fictional globe-spanning conspiracy:</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"606fc2fdbc2136bb6959ccf084b7062c\" data-recommend-id=\"image://606fc2fdbc2136bb6959ccf084b7062c\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A guy dressed as assassin\'s creed assassin pretends to assassinate a guy dressed as Jesus at a Renaissance Faire.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"606fc2fdbc2136bb6959ccf084b7062c\" data-recommend-id=\"image://606fc2fdbc2136bb6959ccf084b7062c\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A guy dressed as assassin\'s creed assassin pretends to assassinate a guy dressed as Jesus at a Renaissance Faire.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Eat your heart out, <em>Super Smash Bros</em>.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Many of these characters coalesce in <em>Renaissance Faire</em>’s central hub, which is structured like a village green from an olde-timey town, surrounded by shops (sorry, shoppes) and restaurants. At any vendor, you can fork over in-game currency for a class of restorational items known as “food.” (This currency looks a whole lot like, and converts to the same exact amount as, USD. No place accepts what NPCs refer to as Lady Visa, but there are various magical machines that allow you to use said Lady to source currency, if you’ve the patience for queues (sorry, queueses).) The developers clearly went to lengths to include cuisine that’s meant to evoke the era—y’know, stuff like chicken fingers, hot dogs, falafel, fried calamari, beef gyro, French fries, bloomin’ onions, nachos, and, of course, turkey legs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In nearly all cases, those items cost an arm and a (turkey) leg. The lone reasonably affordable item on the menu is something called a BBQ sundae, which looks like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"e07666161e3be59fd7bbdf9525b62c64\" data-recommend-id=\"image://e07666161e3be59fd7bbdf9525b62c64\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Two people stare at a bbq sundae at a Renaissance Faire.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"e07666161e3be59fd7bbdf9525b62c64\" data-recommend-id=\"image://e07666161e3be59fd7bbdf9525b62c64\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Two people stare at a bbq sundae at a Renaissance Faire.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Honestly? Delicious. Instant 100/100 HP.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">On the fringe of the green, and sprinkled throughout <em>Renaissance Faire</em>’s densely packed world, you’ll find various pubs. Many of these sport names that are totally innocuous on paper but could easily be referred to incorrectly “by mistake” for laughs (to wit: the Cock and Bull, or the Puss’n’Boots). Despite <em>Renaissance Faire</em> being rated E for Everyone, you’ll of course come across no shortage of players who mess those names up in a decidedly T-for-Teen-rated manner. These pubs sell era-appropriate beverages like mead, wine, and cider. You can also imbibe the so-called Lady Sprite. Water costs an egregious five bucks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Yes, that’s one catch of <em>Renaissance Faire</em>: It’s utterly rife with microtransactions, few of which seem set at a fair price point. In fact, you could make a reasonable case that the microtransactions are the point.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Pretty much anywhere you go in <em>Renaissance Faire</em>, you’ll see something to buy. Along roads called Tinker’s Trail and Spende Penny Lane, you can buy rings, charms, bracelets, necklaces, and other gem-adorned accessories. By Lakeside Market, you can buy wool cloaks and leather boots and musical instruments that would fit right in at your local Guitar Center.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You needn’t look hard to find tapestries of housepets or chalices shaped like dragons. At the weapons shop, as with the vast cast of characters, you’ll see wares commonly associated with popular characters from video games: an energy sword from <em>Halo</em>, a buster sword from <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em>, Mjolnir from <em>Marvel’s Avengers</em>.</p>\n<aside class=\"slideshow-inset js_slideshow align--bleed\"></aside>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Despite the self-evident ode to capitalism, <em>Renaissance Faire</em>’s vendors aren’t the slightest bit pushy. It’s the fellow players you have to watch out for. As our game was winding down, one of my party members picked up a drinking horn that would make Eivor proud: carved from bone, lacquered, a foot-and-a-half long, sheathed in a burnished leather harness. The thing could probably hold an entire pint—an entire <em>British</em> pint, at that! I, clearly afflicted by the “peer pressure” status effect, didn’t want to spend $65 on a microtransaction, but also didn’t want to walk away empty-handed. So I settled for a smaller horn. $45.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I later learned it could hold just one-third of one bottle of beer.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Also, it was cracked.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">These cosmetic items are all optional and don’t offer any notable gameplay benefits for <em>Renaissance Faire</em>, so if you’re not a sucker like me, you can get by just fine without them. But considering you can’t go elsewhere to source the necessary healing items (like water, which, again: five freakin’ bucks!), the entire microtransaction system feels exploitative by design, to put it charitably.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">There are also inconsistencies in dialogue among NPCs. For every bartender who asks to see your “drinking parchments,” you’ll meet another who says, bluntly and with modern cadence, “ID?” Whenever you leave a tip, as you should if you’re role-playing a Paragon hero, the bartender clashes a cymbal and rallies the crowd for hoots and hollers. Some NPCs get into it. Others merely offer polite thanks. Personally, I far prefer the latter, as the former can get cloying—both for the patron and, assuredly, the bartender, who’d have to do so dozens if not thousands of times over the span of the game. It’s an unmistakable sign the developers didn’t scrutinize the script as well as they could have, and perhaps didn’t fully consider what they’re asking of their NPCs (who I desperately hope are paid a fair wage).</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"9bb345257cd952441f66ec5d83eaf4bb\" data-recommend-id=\"image://9bb345257cd952441f66ec5d83eaf4bb\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A woman holds a piece of chicken in front of a cat while both are on stage at a Renaissance Faire\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"9bb345257cd952441f66ec5d83eaf4bb\" data-recommend-id=\"image://9bb345257cd952441f66ec5d83eaf4bb\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A woman holds a piece of chicken in front of a cat while both are on stage at a Renaissance Faire\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Other NPCs are always on their game in the various shows you can see. <em>Renaissance Faire</em> is played in real-time, dictated by a complex schedule divided into 15-minute blocks (10:00 a.m. to 6:45 p.m.) spread out over 19 levels. At Queen’s Grove, you can catch historical lectures and performances of Shakespeare. Pagon Wagon Stage hosts comedy shows throughout the day. The Fortune Stage, meanwhile, is home to four daily showings of a variety event called Cirque de Sewer, which stars three cat NPCs performing stunts as directed by a human NPC. (Surely this won’t surprise you, but the cat characters barely comply with instruction. It’s hilarious.) Elsewhere, you can catch demonstrations of glass-blowing, falconry, and acrobatics.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s impossible to see everything; playing <em>Renaissance Faire</em> means making strategic assessments about where you should be and when you should be there (and rallying your party to follow). If you’re a micromanager who loves games like <em>Cities: Skylines</em>, <em>Surviving Mars</em>, or <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/how-to-build-an-unstoppable-party-in-bravely-default-2-1846363373\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/how-to-build-an-unstoppable-party-in-bravely-default-2-1846363373\">th<!-- -->e job-designation subsystem in <em>Bravely Default 2</em></a></span>, you’ll feel a similar thrill from <em>RenFaire</em>.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The crown jewel, at least per crowd size, is the Roselawn Tournament Field level, where you can see the Joust of Skill, the Royal Joust, and the Joust to the Death (PG-13). I’ll let you in on something: It is not, in fact, to the death. Actually, in none of these events do any riders even fall off their horses! Whichever rider taps the other rider with a big stick first wins. <em>Game of Thrones: The Game (of Thrones)</em> this is not. The developers of <em>RenFaire</em> clearly sanitized any wisp of violence from their game, presumably to ensure prime shelf placement in Ye Walmarte.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But that’s such a minor note, as you do not play <em>Renaissance Faire</em> for the violence. (Please, please do not play <em>Renaissance Faire</em> for the violence.) You play for the camaraderie, for the turkey legs, for the brief but all-consuming and ever-lasting sense of escapism—a whirlwind tourist’s trip to a place, untethered from time and responsibility, where you can do nothing but go with the flow. How rare. How beautiful.</p>\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 khcaUW\">\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Two years ago, the idea to play <em>RenFaire ‘19</em> started as an inside joke among some friends and me. We showed up in jeans and plain shirts. Strolling down Storybrook Lane, we reflected on Mr. Brain Flip’s eloquent bus soliloquy and, I’ll confess, teased him a bit.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">By the middle of the afternoon, as my party and I were sitting in a circle with a dozen people dressed as pirates, all of us shouting along to a rendition of “<span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGyPuey-1Jw\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGyPuey-1Jw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Drunken Sailor</a></span>,” it hit me: Our brains were well and truly flipped. And they weren’t gonna un-flip. (Pleading the Fifth on how much blackberry mead we’d consumed at that point—the drunken effects are surprisingly realistic.) It’s not so often you get to experience a paradigmatic intellectual shift over the course of an afternoon. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">That experience colored my and my party’s approach to <em>RenFaire ‘21</em>, namely to take its intoxicating effects seriously. This time, we came prepared. This time, we decked out our characters in our Halloween Sunday best. This time, we made sure to bring extra currency. This time, we modded in several flasks of high-proof booze because those mead vendors are so damn expensive and also have excruciatingly long lines.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"7ce22ce0087bdcb0d9cfe81ad0553f51\" data-recommend-id=\"image://7ce22ce0087bdcb0d9cfe81ad0553f51\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Two knights riding horses at a Renaissance Faire.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"7ce22ce0087bdcb0d9cfe81ad0553f51\" data-recommend-id=\"image://7ce22ce0087bdcb0d9cfe81ad0553f51\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Two knights riding horses at a Renaissance Faire.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In this, <em>RenFaire</em> reminds me somewhat of <em>Destiny 2</em>.

The opening battle between the men who would become Sub-Zero and Scorpion is one of my favorite cinema moments of the year. The remaining 98 minutes? Not so much. The fights are outstanding, the acting is okay, and the story is complete garbage.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">First off, if you’re looking for a brutal spectacle, <em>Mortal Kombat</em> delivers. If you’re in this to see mostly familiar characters get hit so hard that your teeth rattle, you’re good. If you want to see modern fatalities, the gruesome gory ones, depicted in a somewhat passable facsimile of real life, that’s in there too. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Director Simon McQuoid did an excellent job making attractive people look like they are killing each other, and the attractive people are very good at being attractive. Many of them aren’t too shabby at acting either. Josh Lawson is a treat as cutthroat mercenary Kano, delivering some truly laugh-out-loud moments. Joe Taslim as Bi-Han / Sub-Zero and Hiroyuki Sanada as Hanzo Hasashi / Scorpion are so good in the opening moments they had me fooled into thinking the movie might be much better than I hoped. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"> <small><em>There’s a lot of good stuff in the first seven minutes of the movie. </em></small></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Following that fateful fight the movie jumps to modern times, where things pretty quickly go wrong. We’re introduced to Cole, played by Lewis Tan, a down-on-his luck MMA fighter and family man who finds himself thrust into an ancient tournament between Earthrealm and Outworld because he carries a mystical dragon birthmark passed down by his ancestor, Scorpion. Cole is completely unaware of the meaning of the <em>Mortal Kombat</em> logo on his body until Jax, played by the delightful Mehcad Brooks (Jimmy Olsen from CW’s <em>Supergirl</em>), shows up to fill him in. Cole’s the type of guy who never thought to Google “dragon head in circle birthmark.” If he was, he would have known that this special mark only appears on warriors tasked with defending Earthrealm in regular <em>Mortal Kombat</em> tournaments.<br></p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"wtzfofeyjcgjm7fo0bs1\" data-recommend-id=\"image://wtzfofeyjcgjm7fo0bs1\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"660\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"wtzfofeyjcgjm7fo0bs1\" data-recommend-id=\"image://wtzfofeyjcgjm7fo0bs1\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"660\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">That’s kind of stupid, right? It gets even more stupid. Apparently if someone with the mark is killed, the mark then transfers to their killer. That’s how the brutish and mostly-inept Kano winds up in the tournament, while a more capable character like Sonya Blade does not. Hmm.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Unfortunately for the entire Earthrealm crew—that is Cole, Kano, Liu Kang, Raiden, Jax, and Kung Lao—villainous Outworld boss Shang Tsung has come up with an evil plan. Instead of Outworld merely defeating Earthrealm in the Mortal Kombat tournament, as it’s done several times over the centuries, he decides to send out his minions to murder Earthrealm’s heroes beforehand. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">That’s right. There is no tournament in this <em>Mortal Kombat</em> movie. Instead, Shang Tsung and pals Sub-Zero, Mileena, Nitara, Kabal, Reiko, and Goro attack Earth’s champions and their families directly. It took Shang Tsung hundreds of years to come up with this plan. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s kind of brilliant, really. Earthrealm’s forces are vulnerable. One fighter has his arms ripped off by Sub-Zero in the trailer. Two others are still in the middle of training, trying to awaken their latent super powers. By the way, that’s how <em>Mortal Kombat</em> fighters get their special attacks in this world: T<!-- -->hey awaken with use. Yes, even the mechanical ones. It’s so dumb. </p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"iyjvvtpapk3irtdurugq\" data-recommend-id=\"image://iyjvvtpapk3irtdurugq\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"660\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"iyjvvtpapk3irtdurugq\" data-recommend-id=\"image://iyjvvtpapk3irtdurugq\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"660\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Maybe dumb is what a <em>Mortal Kombat</em> movie needs to be. Perhaps the best possible outcome is a film with really cool fighting, a few giggles, and a painfully bad plot. It’s really good at all of those things. The idea of a regular tournament held to determine if one realm can invade the other is pretty ridiculous. Maybe Shang Tsung is on to something with his diabolical “just kill everybody” plan.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You can find out if this particular mix of good, bad, and stupid suits your own B-movie sensibilities tomorrow, when the new <em>Mortal Kombat</em> movie makes its theatrical and HBO Max debut. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">.</p>', '2024-01-10 16:32:01', '2024-01-10 16:32:01', 'Mortal Kombat 2021: The Kotaku Movie Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/rus1xmh8e4fl3u8p471w.jpg', 'etc', 'https://kotaku.com/mortal-kombat-2021-the-kotaku-movie-review-1846744005', 'As I said last month following a preview of the film’s first 12 minutes, the new...', ''),

That’s why I’m thankful for <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://arcade1up.com/products/star-wars\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://arcade1up.com/products/star-wars\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Arcade1Up’s $500 <em>Star Wars</em> home arcade machine</a></span>. It takes me back to the ‘80s, when fans didn’t know any better and were happy with what we had.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Released in 1983 in both standup and cockpit configurations, Atari’s<em> Star Wars</em> game was a unique presence in ‘80s arcades, shopping centers, and movie theater lobbies. The cabinet drew the eye, with dueling X-wings and TIE Fighters framingthe iconic logo. Voice samples from actors Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Alec Guinness, and James Earl Jones lured players in, along with the growls of Chewbacca and the beeps of R2-D2. </p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 dlwqzz align--right js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"csagjmwiixcxuaigpsmb\" data-recommend-id=\"image://csagjmwiixcxuaigpsmb\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1200\" data-height=\"1551\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" style=\"width:1200px\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"csagjmwiixcxuaigpsmb\" data-recommend-id=\"image://csagjmwiixcxuaigpsmb\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1200\" data-height=\"1551\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The most unique feature of the cabinet, the feature that captured my imagination and many of my parents’ quarters, was the flight yoke. In lieu of a basic joystick, the <em>Star Wars</em> arcade game featured real spaceship controls, or at least what 11-year-old me imagined were real spaceship controls. The two-handed flight yoke added an amazing tactile feel to the game, helping the vector graphics representing the TIE Fighters and Death Star come to life. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The flight yoke is the key to the new Star Wars arcade machine’s unique charm. The folks at Arcade1Up have recreated it perfectly in three-quarter scale. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"k3vqdhih1cji2zj4y8jw\" data-recommend-id=\"image://k3vqdhih1cji2zj4y8jw\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1500\" data-height=\"1500\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"k3vqdhih1cji2zj4y8jw\" data-recommend-id=\"image://k3vqdhih1cji2zj4y8jw\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1500\" data-height=\"1500\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">My hands are much larger than they were in the ‘80s, but the Arcade1Up <em>Star Wars</em> flight yoke feels just like the real thing did back in the day, even at three-quarter scale. It’s still an outstanding way to control a spaceship. It’s oddly intuitive as well. My eight-year-olds took to it like old pros once they figured out that the 17-inch LCD screen was not touch-sensitive. </p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"s3ky31egpey6mfbuvnge\" data-recommend-id=\"image://s3ky31egpey6mfbuvnge\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1440\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"s3ky31egpey6mfbuvnge\" data-recommend-id=\"image://s3ky31egpey6mfbuvnge\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1440\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The Arcade1Up <em>Star Wars</em> home arcade machine emulates three classic Atari games. There’s the original <em>Star Wars</em>, in which players do battle against colorful TIE Fighters while attacking the Death Star. 1985’s <em>Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back</em> was a conversion for the cabinet that recreates the Battle of Hoth, with Luke piloting a snowspeeder fighting walkers and Han Solo in the Falcon navigating an asteroid field.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The third game, <em>Return of the Jedi</em>, came out in 1984. Instead of a vector-based display, it featured the more standard CRT-based raster graphics and was presented in an isometric overhead view. Using the same flight yoke as the other two games, players piloted the Millennium Falcon, speeder bikes, and an AT-ST. I prefer the vector games, but all three play quite well on the Arcade1Up cabinet. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This is my second Arcade1Up machine. I also own the <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://arcade1up.com/products/final-fight\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://arcade1up.com/products/final-fight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">more traditional <em>Final Fight</em> cabinet</a></span>. It’s cool, but nowhere near as cool as the <em>Star Wars</em> model. It’s also nowhere near as expensive as the <em>Star Wars</em> model, which runs $500 to the <em>Final Fight</em> cabinet’s $200. The extra price is a combination of licensing, the unique controller hardware, and the included riser, which makes the machine around five feet tall—the perfect height for me in my wheelchair. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Despite the unique hardware, assembly of the unit only takes around an hour. As I am paralyzed from the chest down, my wife put it together for me. Everything works, nothing has fallen off, and nothing has exploded.

It was fun. I didn’t know what I doing and over time I learned what RAM was and what a motherboard is. Then I stopped doing that, bought some consoles and only bought pre-made PCs at Walma<!-- -->rt that I would use mainly for writing. But last year I bought an actual gaming PC and have since been improving it. Recently, I finally replaced the video card and it was an ordeal.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Back when I was younger, all the PC parts I had access to were cheap and old. All the parts were covered in dust or were part of the computers that nobody wanted. Breaking anything didn’t matter. Because it was all garbage and leftovers anyways. But when I decided to install a brand new video card into my main and only computer, which I use for work too, things became a lot more stressful. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I did all the research and found the video card I wanted. And it was on sale on Black Friday. So I went down to the store with some family and picked it up, then brought it home and began the process of installing this damn thing. </p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Installing A Video Card\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"installing-a-video-card\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">When I was a kid, getting into PCs was tricky. Most of the computers I was working on were old plastic and metal boxes. Nothing just opened easily. Sometimes I would break cases trying to get to the guts of an old Compaq. But today, PCs are so easy to open. My case has three hand-tightened screws to take off and that’s it. After doing that I was face-to-face with my PC’s innards. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The first thing I needed to do was remove the video card. This involved removing some screws on the outside of the PC case. The new video card didn’t come with any instructions or tips, so as I worked on the PC my girlfriend looked up instructions online. The first site she found wasn’t very helpful.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">“It just says, remove the old card carefully and replace it with the new card, making sure to plug all the cables in before closing the case.” Very helpful. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The thing is, and I knew this as I nervously began poking at my old video card, there isn’t much to installing a new video card. It is, at least on paper, very easy. But I have big hands and I’m a bit clumsy, so as I started to pull out the old video card I couldn’t really SEE what I was doing. Though I did see something: The motherboard started to flex as I pulled on the card. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">“Shit!” I stopped and paced around a little bit. I could feel my heartbeat and even though it was nearly 2 AM and I had been shopping all night, I wasn’t tired anymore. The last thing I needed was to break my motherboard. I still needed a PC to work on. Plus I didn’t want to buy and install a new motherboard.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"amtr9x2yzg76tjjblzt4\" data-recommend-id=\"image://amtr9x2yzg76tjjblzt4\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1023\" data-height=\"576\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"amtr9x2yzg76tjjblzt4\" data-recommend-id=\"image://amtr9x2yzg76tjjblzt4\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1023\" data-height=\"576\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The last time I installed a video card was way back in the early 2000s. I wanted to play <em>Battlefield 1942 </em>and <em>Alien Versus Predator 2. </em>But they wouldn’t work on my computer. I called the support line listed on the back of the box of AVP 2 and eventually was told I needed a better video card. After convincing my parents to buy one for me, I got home and installed it. The games worked and I played them for years. I have no idea how I did that. I didn’t even really understand what a graphics card was and yet I was able to install it and start playing. Younger Zack was, it seems, smarter than I realized and braver. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">So after pacing for a few minutes that memory of young Zack installing a video card entered my head. I can do this. So I got back in there and start pulling again, but this time I also pushed forward on the card a bit and then BAM! The card was out. Putting the new card in was less scary and after a few minutes of cheering and my GF and I laughing at how nervous I was, I slid the PC back to my desk, turned it on and... nothing. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The monitor said no signal. I waited. Then I turned off the PC and tried again. Nothing. The computer was making noises, the fans on the card were spinning and the computer was clearly doing something, but no picture. Great, I broke my computer. And then, as if the universe decided to finally give me a break, the monitor popped on and the computer boot screen was there. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But those few minutes, where I thought I had broken my entire PC or ruined a new video card, were terrifying. I don’t need to play <em>Alien Isolation</em> or <em>Silent Hill. </em>Next time I want to feel scared I’ll install a video card.</p>', '2024-01-10 16:32:01', '2024-01-10 16:32:01', 'Installing A Video Card: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/bubkyxhabrtazyy9q1vp.jpg', 'etc', 'https://kotaku.com/installing-a-video-card-the-kotaku-review-1840243131', 'Long ago, when I was much younger and had more free time, I would pull apart old...', ''),

That’s their territory. I get it. But when one of these things comes<!-- --> into my apartment, I find it annoying. It also is a terrible thing to come home to in the middle of the night.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Earlier this week I attended a wonderful birthday party with friends. It was a good party, not one of those weird parties where people drink energy drinks and mix them together <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/every-flavor-of-game-fuel-reviewed-and-then-mixed-toget-1837348411\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/every-flavor-of-game-fuel-reviewed-and-then-mixed-toget-1837348411\">into gross concoctions</a></span>. After hours of fun and enjoyment, my girlfriend and I headed home. We arrived, turned on the lights, said hello to the cats and began to relax. That was until suddenly I heard my girlfriend shout my name from the living room. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">“Zaaaaccccckkkkk? What’s this? Is this.....a SNAKE?!” </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Her reaction was a mixture of fear, anger, shock and a bit of confusion. All fair reactions to have when you find a snake in your house. She had walked over to the sliding glass door and discovered a coiled up black snake, about a foot and an inch long. It was resting on a small brown rug. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I walked over, assuming it wasn’t a snake. Maybe it was too dark and she was confused? Maybe it was a piece of string that had been piled up by the cats? But when I rounded the corner and found her crouched over a black pile on the rug I almost immediately saw what it was. It was, in fact, a snake. </p>\n\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Coming Home To A Snake In Your House\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"coming-home-to-a-snake-in-your-house\">\n\n</section></aside>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">A lot of things shot through my head at that moment. Too many to list here. But two key things stayed in my mind: What kind of snake is this and how do I get rid of it? I grew up in Florida. I’ve handled snakes before, even though I really shouldn’t have. Look, I watched a lot of <em>The Crocodile Hunter</em> and <em>Jeff Corwin Experience </em>on Animal Planet. I also lived in a state that is basically a tropical jungle on top of a swamp. So I spent time outside catching things a kid shouldn’t catch. As a result, I was able to identify the snake as a Garter Snake, which is non-venomous. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Here’s the thing though. Looking at images of garter snakes now, after the event, I feel very confident that I identified it correctly. But at the moment, with a snake in your home and cats coming over to investigate, I was far less confident. So as my girlfriend held the cats back, I grabbed a small bowl and gently, but quickly, covered the snake. Then I slid the entire brown rug outside and as I did this the bowl shifted and out popped the head of a snake. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">My hand, which was holding the bowl down, was now a few inches from a small snakehead which was looking at me. I calmy, but rather quickly, lifted my hand and in one motion spun the rug onto the porch and flipped the plastic bowl off the snake.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"eusekp0bfk8sww8qgavt\" data-recommend-id=\"image://eusekp0bfk8sww8qgavt\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1560\" data-height=\"758\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"eusekp0bfk8sww8qgavt\" data-recommend-id=\"image://eusekp0bfk8sww8qgavt\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1560\" data-height=\"758\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">After our snake encounter, we plugged up a small gap in the sliding glass door, which seems to be the only way it could have gotten inside. The fear of another snake coming in lingered for the rest of the night. I’m not worried about another Garter Snake sneaking in. I’m worried about a dangerous snake getting in through the same method. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I’m also sorry that during this ordeal I never snapped a photo of the snake. While I was dealing with this snake, the last thing I thought about was documenting it with a camera. This is more evidence that found footage films are bullshit. Seriously, I only ran into a small snake and didn’t film it. Why would someone fighting an evil bigfoot or whatever film it for hours and hours?<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">After all of this, as it slithered away into bushes that I will now fear a bit for the next few months, I felt proud that I didn’t just kill it. Snakes are amazing creatures, important parts of our local ecosystems and deserve respect. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But it absolutely sucks when they decide to slither into your house in the middle of the night. Not hoping for any sequels.

The movie, which is a sequel to Legendary Pictures’ 2014 <em>Godzilla</em>, feels like a natural evolution of the previous film. In some ways, it’s a better movie—rather, a better <em>Godzilla</em> movie. In other ways, it’s not.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Gareth Edward’s <em>Godzilla</em> was proof that Hollywood no longer was confusing kaiju with dinosaurs <em>à la</em> Roland Emmerich’s 1998 film. This was a movie steeped in the lore of Godzilla, and perhaps fittingly for a reboot, it appeared to be heavily influenced by Toho’s 1954 original. The new Hollywood take was moody, ponderous, and for many fans, short on monster fights. Its sequel sure ain’t.</p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 jXybyg align--left js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"dutgsvjliqc35t5vgegw\" data-recommend-id=\"image://dutgsvjliqc35t5vgegw\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"848\" data-height=\"355\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" style=\"width:848px\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"dutgsvjliqc35t5vgegw\" data-recommend-id=\"image://dutgsvjliqc35t5vgegw\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"848\" data-height=\"355\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Godzilla: King of Monsters</em> centers around a family still mourning a loss suffered several years earlier when Godzilla and the Muto ravaged San Francisco. Still dealing with grief, research scientist Mark Russel (played by Kyle Chandler) is now estranged from his scientist wife Emma Russel (Vera Farmiga) who is raising their daughter Maddie (Millie Bobby Brown). Monarch, the secret government organization from the 2014 film as well as Jordan Vogt-Roberts’ <em>Kong: Skull Island</em>, is back. The company turns to Mark for help after a group of terrorists that has kidnapped his wife and daughter then makes a move to unleash a truly deadly kaiju foe. Meanwhile, Dr. Serizawa (once again played by Ken Watanabe) urges all to put their faith in Godzilla to handle the situation.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 dlwqzz align--right js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"h1alizqmscabanhahove\" data-recommend-id=\"image://h1alizqmscabanhahove\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"849\" data-height=\"353\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" style=\"width:849px\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"h1alizqmscabanhahove\" data-recommend-id=\"image://h1alizqmscabanhahove\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"849\" data-height=\"353\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In the original 1954 film, <em>Godzilla</em> was only on screen for around eight minutes. For audiences of the day, seeing the first kaiju film ever made, that must have been mind-blowing. The 2014 film also only featured around eight minutes of Godzilla, largely cloaked in murky darkness. Modern moviegoers who were eager to see more big-time Hollywood special effects in IMAX were left unsatisfied. But for Edwards, who was looking back to the 1954 original, holding back Godzilla as long as possible apparently made sense. It would’ve been nice to see what was going on, though.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>King of the Monsters</em> isn’t about holding back Godzilla, nor any of the other kaiju. It’s about getting them on screen and having them pummel each other. If you want to see giant monsters beat the tar out of each other, this is the movie for you. <em>King of the Monsters</em> is the most fully realized CG <em>Godzilla</em> film to date, and that’s including the two previous Hollywood movies and Toho’s <em>Godzilla Resurgence</em>, a movie that seems to delight in ditching <em>Godzilla</em> movie conventions in order to make a jab at bureaucratic Japanese politics. </p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"zhfbeifjiiivjxoquvp3\" data-recommend-id=\"image://zhfbeifjiiivjxoquvp3\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"848\" data-height=\"355\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"zhfbeifjiiivjxoquvp3\" data-recommend-id=\"image://zhfbeifjiiivjxoquvp3\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"848\" data-height=\"355\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Legendary has packed some brutal fight scenes in here, with stuff I’d never seen in a <em>Godzilla</em> movie. Thankfully, the kaiju battles aren’t in the dark as they sadly were in the 2014 film. <em>King of the Monsters</em> is lit with oranges and blues, with a clear understanding that what people want to see is giant monsters throwing down. That they most certainly do. With Michael Dougherty, a diehard <em>Godzilla</em> aficionado since childhood, at the helm, these fights are by a fan for fans. But it’s more than just a slugfest; there are a good number of easter eggs, such as a subtle reference to Mothra’s <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://godzilla.fandom.com/wiki/Shobijin\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://godzilla.fandom.com/wiki/Shobijin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fairies</a></span>.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 jXybyg align--left js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"jn3kvysc1bmiyc1vliqb\" data-recommend-id=\"image://jn3kvysc1bmiyc1vliqb\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"847\" data-height=\"354\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" style=\"width:847px\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"jn3kvysc1bmiyc1vliqb\" data-recommend-id=\"image://jn3kvysc1bmiyc1vliqb\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"847\" data-height=\"354\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Dougherty seems born to direct<em> Godzilla</em> movies. There is a genuine wonder and awesomeness about the kaiju that was absent in Hollywood’s previous films. He truly cares about these monsters and wants to make them as realistic as possible. I just wish I got that same feeling about the human characters, who feel more like chess pieces to move the plot around. They never feel authentic. Their motivations are either unclear, superficial, or unbelievable. The plot does include the interesting idea of flipping a protagonist into an antagonist, but that’s all it is, an interesting idea. That idea’s execution is inconceivable. In the 2014 film, the characters were, for the most part, believable and empathetic. Their motivations made sense, and even if the movie ran out of gas by the end, those motivations alone were what propelled the story.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 dlwqzz align--right js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"uuprb3p40hmzlhvmqkpa\" data-recommend-id=\"image://uuprb3p40hmzlhvmqkpa\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"850\" data-height=\"353\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" style=\"width:850px\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"uuprb3p40hmzlhvmqkpa\" data-recommend-id=\"image://uuprb3p40hmzlhvmqkpa\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"850\" data-height=\"353\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In <em>King of the Monsters</em>, the actions of characters often didn’t make sense. They were propelled by the plot, instead of the other way around. There is one exception to this: Dr. Serizawa. The movie holds him in the same reverence that it does Godzilla and the other kaiju. Considering the character’s place in the <em>Godzilla</em> universe and Dougherty’s reverence for it, that is not surprising. Ken Watanabe, per usual, shines with grace and dignity. In any case, most people seeing this movie will view the non-kaiju scenes as filler between the monster stuff. Fair enough. In that regard, the movie does deliver. This is <em>King of the Monsters</em>, after all, and not King of the Believable Human Characters. <br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">When I left the movie, I kept imagining what it would’ve been like if the human drama from the previous film had been melded with this movie’s kaiju battles. The result would have been a better movie, but that’s not what <em>King of the Monsters</em> is, nor where its interests lie. This is a kaiju royal rumble. It’s about iconic monsters squaring off, sizing each other up, and fighting. That is what <em>King of the Monsters</em> is. And in the end, that’s all it needs to be.<br></p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"gnaj2d4aslfoeeofnlaw\" data-recommend-id=\"image://gnaj2d4aslfoeeofnlaw\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"848\" data-height=\"352\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"gnaj2d4aslfoeeofnlaw\" data-recommend-id=\"image://gnaj2d4aslfoeeofnlaw\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"848\" data-height=\"352\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>', '2024-01-10 16:32:01', '2024-01-10 16:32:01', 'Godzilla: King of the Monsters: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/b84wwrgvklgh2snrlu9m.jpg', 'etc', 'https://kotaku.com/godzilla-the-king-of-the-monsters-the-kotaku-review-1835058558', 'It’s fitting that the first few minutes of Godzilla: King of the Monsters are a ...', ''),

Hollywood has an abysmal track record with video game movies, but this time, it seems to have pulled off the impossible: Making an enjoyable live-action Pokémon movie that will delight fans and non-fans alike.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong><em>This piece was first published on May 3, 2019. We’re bumping it today for the movie’s release.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Set mostly in Ryme City, where Pocket Monsters live alongside humans, the movie follows the game’s basic plot. While trying to find his missing father, a young man named Tim Goodman discovers he can talk to a crime-solving Pikachu. The central mystery isn’t only what happened to Tim’s father, but also, who is making the drug called “R” that makes Pokémon go berserk. <em>Detective Pikachu</em> follows a rather formulaic detective film plot but so does the original game. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 dlwqzz align--right js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"wquy8wijw0hyfvj9cpic\" data-recommend-id=\"image://wquy8wijw0hyfvj9cpic\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1501\" data-height=\"797\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" style=\"width:1501px\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"wquy8wijw0hyfvj9cpic\" data-recommend-id=\"image://wquy8wijw0hyfvj9cpic\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1501\" data-height=\"797\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But <em>Detective Pikachu</em> doesn’t share the same burden that weighs down so many adaptations, whether that’s video game or anime. For example, one thing that continually plagues made-in-Japan anime and manga adaptations is how many fans want the live-action version to simply be that: the anime and manga brought to life, as is, with humans. This means that character costumes and attributes, which might look cool when drawn, get directly translated to live-action, often with awkward or off-putting results that do not look realistic but instead appear downright goofy. The other extreme is something like the <em>Attack on Titan</em> cinematic movies which completely disregard the character’s original designs for a localized version. <em>Detective Pikachu</em> takes a different approach. <br></p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"uov613tt72iytbqkllix\" data-recommend-id=\"image://uov613tt72iytbqkllix\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1912\" data-height=\"801\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"uov613tt72iytbqkllix\" data-recommend-id=\"image://uov613tt72iytbqkllix\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1912\" data-height=\"801\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The smartest thing Legendary Pictures did with <em>Detective Pikachu</em> was to not adapt <em>Red &amp; Blue</em> — or any mainline <em>Pokémon</em> game or the long-running anime. The expectations would be too high and inevitably end in tears. Instead, by starting with a spin-off, the filmmakers were able to adeptly sidestep those expectations for how characters should talk, look and dress, giving room for the actors to bring them to life. (The <em>Resident Evil</em> movies, the most successful video game cinematic franchise, previously took a similar approach: Don’t redo the games, but instead, create a cinematic universe based on the in-game one. <em>Detective Pikachu</em>, however, has a far better understanding of its source material.)<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 jXybyg align--left js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"b7tflo5xvse093n6p9yi\" data-recommend-id=\"image://b7tflo5xvse093n6p9yi\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1443\" data-height=\"799\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" style=\"width:1443px\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"b7tflo5xvse093n6p9yi\" data-recommend-id=\"image://b7tflo5xvse093n6p9yi\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1443\" data-height=\"799\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The character of Tim Goodman from the game isn’t beloved like Ash from the anime. In both the game and the movie, he’s a former wanna-be trainer turned insurance salesman with a rotten relationship with his father; in the movie, Tim is actually far more interesting and well-drawn than the in-game original. Since the other lead character Lucy Stevens doesn’t appear in the game, there aren’t the same expectations placed on a, say, a live-action version of Misty. Lucy is an intern at a news network, sick of writing listicles and hungry to break a big story. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The makers of <em>Detective Pikachu </em>certainly appear eager to please, but it’s not through cheap visceral thrills. Instead, so much of the movie appears to be set on getting the world of Pokémon as right as a big-budget movie can.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In what must be a cinematic first, the movie adaptation is more fully realized than the game in scope and breadth. The 3DS vision of Ryme City is rather bland, especially compared to the movie’s incarnation, which looks like Neo-Tokyo meets Pokémon. The urban cityscape is filled with layered with Pokémon cameos and layered with Easter Eggs, advertising shops like Charizard’s BBQ and the quite-clever Snap Camera Shop. In comparison, the game’s Ryme City is bland, and interestingly, smacks of the movie’s first ho-hum location, the town of Leaventown.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"ixmllscs10vgmte2tqvo\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ixmllscs10vgmte2tqvo\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1698\" data-height=\"800\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"ixmllscs10vgmte2tqvo\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ixmllscs10vgmte2tqvo\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1698\" data-height=\"800\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Early in the picture, when Justice Smith as Tim Goodman is riding the train from Leaventown to Ryme City, a Lickitung sticks out its tongue and then proceeds to lick the side of his face, covering it in globs of salvia. It’s gross but played for laughs, which perfectly sums up what meeting Lickitung would actually be like. This also helps establish that these Pocket Monsters are living, breathing creatures. Some are creepy, others are cuddly, and a couple of them are truly menacing, but they’re all real.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Pokémon are well conceived and fascinating creatures, so the fact that the filmmakers have recognized that and are not content to simply rely on appearances, but have a deeper understanding of what the Pokémon can do, is why this adaptation works so well compared to Hollywood’s other superficial attempts. <em>Detective Pikachu</em> understands <em>Pokémon</em>. It’s why the film works.<br></p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 dlwqzz align--right js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"nawdaq9by8asgdbwbkfp\" data-recommend-id=\"image://nawdaq9by8asgdbwbkfp\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"811\" data-height=\"392\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" style=\"width:811px\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"nawdaq9by8asgdbwbkfp\" data-recommend-id=\"image://nawdaq9by8asgdbwbkfp\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"811\" data-height=\"392\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Often with movie adaptations, only the barest superficial elements from the source material are referenced on-screen. Characters kind of look how they do in the games or share the same barebones modus operandi, and that’s it. In <em>Detective Pikachu</em>, joke after joke centers around Pokémon, and major plot points hinge on the abilities of certain Pokémon, instead of only a series of hollow spot-them-if-you-can cameos, showing how much thought has gone into the production. The movie is acutely aware that it has two audiences: Pokémon fans and non-fans. Early on, there’s a quick and painless explanation of how catching Pokémon works. Even this is laced with smart quips that fans can appreciate. It’s clearly evident the filmmakers did their homework and are enjoying themselves. The world of <em>Pokémon</em> is fertile, and instead of simply scratching its surface, <em>Detective Pikachu</em> delights in going deeper.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Once Ryan Reynolds does make his entrance as the titular detective, the joke ratio does spike suddenly, with nearly every other line a zinger. Reynolds has proven himself one of the most enjoyable and likable actors of his generation, thanks to his ability to not only craft excellent jokes but to deliver them. This is a kid’s movie, so he’s not working blue like in <em>Deadpool</em>, fart and pee-pee jokes aside. The <em>Ted</em> for kids comparison is apt.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"hml55wnede7uow3he4ir\" data-recommend-id=\"image://hml55wnede7uow3he4ir\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1839\" data-height=\"798\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"hml55wnede7uow3he4ir\" data-recommend-id=\"image://hml55wnede7uow3he4ir\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1839\" data-height=\"798\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures brought in some of the best visual effects artists in the business. Director Rob Letterman cut his teeth on CG animation with films like <em>Shark Tale</em> and <em>Monsters vs. Aliens</em>. The filmmakers had the added plus of The Pokémon Company’s involvement, providing notes on the CG character designs. All of these parts came together in the final film and resulted in Pocket Monsters that didn’t feel like live-action translations, but instead, live-action versions.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The movie does take liberties with the game, introducing several huge set pieces, totally different motivations for the antagonist, a new ability for a truly powerful <em>Pokémon</em>, and a completely different ending. The original game has an unsatisfying, unresolved conclusion, whereas the movie adaptation attempts to wrap everything up. I found it awkward and unbelievable, but the rest of the movie was so much fun that this wasn’t a dealbreaker. The big reveal at the end did make me wonder how they’ll pull off the inevitable sequel. However they do, here’s hoping it packs the same fun.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"wdeyvjwnewvacwiodgut\" data-recommend-id=\"image://wdeyvjwnewvacwiodgut\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1306\" data-height=\"799\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"wdeyvjwnewvacwiodgut\" data-recommend-id=\"image://wdeyvjwnewvacwiodgut\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1306\" data-height=\"799\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>', '2024-01-10 16:32:01', '2024-01-10 16:32:01', 'Detective Pikachu Is A Good Movie', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/jixw4ctuhg50cvvwdtyv.jpg', 'etc', 'https://kotaku.com/detective-pikachu-is-a-good-movie-1834466412', 'Based on the Nintendo 3DS game by the same name, Pokémon Detective Pikachu is th...', '');

The original console’s first controller, often nicknamed “<span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_controller\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_controller\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Duke</a></span>” for its comically large size, is remembered for just that: being enormous. Its followup, the “<span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://xbox.fandom.com/wiki/Controller_S\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://xbox.fandom.com/wiki/Controller_S\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Controller S</a></span>,” was serviceable but not particularly notable. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But when Microsoft took its third stab at introducing a gamepad, it arguably struck gold. And now, like the Duke before it, the Xbox 360 controller has returned by way of Hyperkin’s officially licensed replica for PC and modern Xbox consoles, aptly named “Xenon,” after the Xbox 360’s processor. The result is an excellent controller with generous haptic response and solid build quality. It’s the return of an old friend for sure, but one whose price and missing features make it hard to recommend over a modern Xbox Wireless controller.</p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h74674\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>The return of a proven design</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The Xbox 360’s controller felt great in the hands, wisely relegating the “black and white buttons” to the shoulders, where they served as bumpers typically actuated by the sides of your index fingers, freeing up your actual fingers for use on triggers. It made shooters more enjoyable and avoided the sort of fork grip of index and middle fingers usually required for PlayStation gamepads. And on PC, Xbox 360 controllers often worked more seamlessly via XInput than something like a DualShock 3, which usually required additional software.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The Xbox One and current wireless controllers have since replaced the 360, particularly as Microsoft no longer makes the 360 controller. And the current offering from Microsoft is both affordable and of great quality. So what are the advantages of the Xbox 360 gamepad in 2023? </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">After spending the last two weeks primarily gaming on the Xenon on PC across a wide variety of genres, I’m happy to say that the comfort of this gamepad isn’t just nostalgia: This is a genuinely comfortable controller that <!-- -->feels better now that it doesn’t have the big battery pack that used to sit in the middle of the original. That extra space comes at the cost of wireless functionality, much like the original 360’s wired variant. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But if the lack of wireless isn’t an issue for you, the Xenon feels less like a dated throwback than a rather modern option. The buttons are where they’re supposed to be and it’s as comfortable as the Xbox Wireless controller. In fact, I prefer the feel of the Xenon a bit more than the Xbox Wireless controller. I’ll address its shortcomings in a moment, but when playing recent releases on PC, I’m beginning to favor the Xenon over the modern Xbox controller, and not just for the shape alone. </p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"ca21d80558a445f6f36caf61c30eba24\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ca21d80558a445f6f36caf61c30eba24\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A replica of an Xbox 360 controller sits on a table.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"ca21d80558a445f6f36caf61c30eba24\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ca21d80558a445f6f36caf61c30eba24\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A replica of an Xbox 360 controller sits on a table.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h74675\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>A refreshing feel, thunderous rumble, and old-school vibes</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The first thing<!-- --> that stood out to me when I picked up the Xenon were the feel and motion of the analog sticks, which lack the rigid tire-like texture that lines the edges of current Xbox controllers.

But I am going to say that the Xenon offers one of<!-- --> the best iterations<!-- --> of what this design could be. Were this not a replica controller, I would argue for redesigning the d-pad altogether, but it does feel snappier than the original.

They resemble real gun triggers far more than what’s on the standard Xbox controller. That said, I didn’t enjoy that feeling for racing games, where the more narrow pressure against my index finger, since there’s less surface area, didn’t feel as nice.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"be585ff690deefb06874e0eb9d5da2cb\" data-recommend-id=\"image://be585ff690deefb06874e0eb9d5da2cb\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1200\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The reverse side of a replica Xbox 360 controller shows the triggers.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"be585ff690deefb06874e0eb9d5da2cb\" data-recommend-id=\"image://be585ff690deefb06874e0eb9d5da2cb\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1200\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The reverse side of a replica Xbox 360 controller shows the triggers.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But perhaps my favorite feature is the rumble. God does this thing feel great when it vibrates. Explosions have a nice kick and gunfire rumbles in my hand and gives me absolute joy. Sure, more contemporary haptic vibration methods like what’s in the PlayStation 5’s DualSense are nice, but offset weights spinning on motors in a plastic case is a kind of fun that I don’t think will ever get old. The rumble feels stronger than what the Xbox Wireless controller delivers, though that’s a hard metric to measure precisely.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Also, the buttons are fully colored coded. That may not seem like an obvious advantage, but consider that the standard Xbox Wireless controller only colors the letters on the buttons, and for the fancier editions, they’re all <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/controllers/remix-special-edition\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/controllers/remix-special-edition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">uniformly muted</a></span>. Video games are meant to be fun, and it’s nice to see fun colors on a gamepad. I primarily played on a black Xenon controller, and having the yellow, red, green, and blue jewel buttons pop made me feel like I was picking up something exciting to play, not an attempt at<!-- --> trying to look industrial or utilitarian. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"63609a3d41bce5f00165b982b7411a6e\" data-recommend-id=\"image://63609a3d41bce5f00165b982b7411a6e\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Black and red Xbox 360 replica controllers sit on a wooden table.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"63609a3d41bce5f00165b982b7411a6e\" data-recommend-id=\"image://63609a3d41bce5f00165b982b7411a6e\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Black and red Xbox 360 replica controllers sit on a wooden table.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The Xenon comes in black, pink, white, and red. Each with matching colored USB cables. The red is the only odd one as it has gray sides and triggers, which is kind of an eyesore. Meanwhile, the white is very faithful to the launch 360 model (though the black menu buttons sort of mar that). That leaves the pink and black as probably the best <!-- -->of the current Xenon color offerings. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h74676\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>At $50, the wired Xenon nearly competes with the Xbox Wireless controller</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">How much do you value nostalgia? Because when it comes to Xenon, you’re gonna need to keep that in mind. At MSRP, the Xenon controller is $10 less than a standard Xbox wireless controller (which starts at around $60 and goes up for limited edition colors). But if you shop at Amazon or most online retailers (including directly from Microsoft’s store), it’s not uncommon to find a standard Xbox gamepad for $10 off, meaning that the Xenon and Xbox Wireless Controller are often the same price. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If the Xbox 360 controller was your jam and you don’t care about wireless, the answer’s probably clear: This is a faithful recreation and an excellent execution of the form factor. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Personally? Wires don’t bother me. I’m often within three feet of my PC tower and less than that when on my laptop, so a wire is fine for me. Still, you may differ on that, especially if you’re a console player. In that case, even the 10 ft. USB-C cable that comes with the Xenon might not be enough—and it’s not quite cheap enough to be the dedicated “I-don’t-care-what-happens-to-this-here-player-2” gamepad you fish out of a drawer when you’re labored with company who want to game. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"f7f370aa869b059b46b521a6d351f91a\" data-recommend-id=\"image://f7f370aa869b059b46b521a6d351f91a\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1200\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Three Xbox 360 replica controllers, one pink, one white, and one black, sit on a wooden table.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"f7f370aa869b059b46b521a6d351f91a\" data-recommend-id=\"image://f7f370aa869b059b46b521a6d351f91a\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1200\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Three Xbox 360 replica controllers, one pink, one white, and one black, sit on a wooden table.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Even though it doesn’t bother me, the lack of wireless is a friggin’ buzzkill.

I can only guess as to the reasons why.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">And while it is neat to have the 360’s form factor back in hand, I can’t help but wonder if a better version of this controller could exist if it weren’t limited to just being a replica. I’d gladly take some slightly wider triggers, more textured thumbsticks, and a better d-pad design (honestly, even the “satellite dish” design of the current Xbox Wireless controller would be a step up) fused with this overall shape.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The Xenon, overall, is a great controller that easily meets modern standards of gaming. The lack of wireless sucks, and its price is too close to the standard Xbox Wireless controller to suggest you’ll save money by reattaching the cord. That said, the price of entry gets you a new Xbox 360 controller for PC and modern Xboxes, and that’s something that just might be worth a tether and dated d-pad design.</p>', '2024-01-10 16:37:48', '2024-01-10 16:37:48', 'Replica Xbox 360 Controller Nails The Vibes, But Lack Of Wireless Hurts', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/2357149bd16d27a3b4938d52aa5dcc96.jpg', 'controllers', 'https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-controller-xenon-hyperkin-pc-gamepad-1850545502', 'The Xbox’s gamepad wasn’t a hit right out of the gate.

I purchased it in the Before Times thinking it’d make for a great subway companion. But between the short battery life and it being uncomfortable to hold for long periods, I just didn’t ever want to play it much. But there might finally be some light on my Switch’s horizon. Over the last few weeks I’ve been testing Hori’s new Split Pad Compact controller. While it has some cool unique features of its own, the best part might be the way that it’s encouraged me to spend more time with my Switch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Hori’s Split Pad Compact is the successor to its prior Split Pad Pro. Taking the place of traditional Nintendo Joy-Cons, its two halves slot into the usual spaces for portable play on a standard Switch. The Compact’s colors, shape, and general playability have won me over, but it comes with some major caveats: no rumble, no wireless, and no motion-sensing features. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This is an unfortunate trend among many third-party Switch controllers given the variety of proprietary tech Nintendo employs on the console. That might entirely rule out the Split Pad Compact for some games, or for players who (justifiably) find those features essential to the Switch. But if you’ve wanted to check out an alternative to the standard Joy-Con that makes for, in my opinion, a way more comfortable portable experience, the $50 MSRP isn’t too bad for such a thing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The buttons and design also feel rather at home with the Switch. These don’t feel like Xbox or PlayStation buttons. They sit a little bit taller than on a regular Joy-Con, but the trade-off is that I find them a bit more tactile. The analog thumbsticks are much closer to full-size ones (thank god), and overall it has a nice “Nintendo-y” feeling.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The Split Pad Compact is far from the only ergonomically shaped Switch controller (or grip) out there. What really sets it apart in terms of function are the back buttons. These buttons aren’t going to rival an Xbox Elite controller’s paddles, as there are only two of them, but I kinda like it that way. There’s also a turbo feature which lets you rapid-fire a button of your choice. In the games I played, I found little utility with this; turbo will appeal more to those into older-style action games, or RPGs where you have to page through a million text boxes.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"bebe951e8acc0e5fb8d745011134f7ae\" data-recommend-id=\"image://bebe951e8acc0e5fb8d745011134f7ae\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The rear functions of the Hori Split Pad Compact have handy assignable buttons. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"bebe951e8acc0e5fb8d745011134f7ae\" data-recommend-id=\"image://bebe951e8acc0e5fb8d745011134f7ae\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The rear functions of the Hori Split Pad Compact have handy assignable buttons. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Assigning a face button to either of the two rear inputs is a simple three-button combo. You hold down “Assign,” along with the button you wish to map (the capture and home buttons aren’t allowed), then click the rear button you want to assign to; the light will stay on as a solid red to indicate you’ve done it right. Sometimes it takes a couple of tries, but eventually you get the feel for it. There are no profiles for different games, which is a bummer. Switching up button remaps is easy though once you get it, and there are only two back buttons at most to worry about anyway. But there’s another critical limitation here.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Each rear button can only be assigned to the buttons that are on the individual “Joy-Con” itself. Basically, the right back button can only be assigned A, B, X, Y, since they are on the right-side unit. The left button can only activate buttons on the left-hand side. </p>\n\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Hori Split Pad Compact\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"hori-split-pad-compact\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">While I initially grimaced at the rear inputs being limited thus, I ended up finding some great utility in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>. After playing this game with the Hori, I’ve come to realize that, OK, weapons breaking ain’t so bad; what was most annoying was actually just having to move my thumb from stick to d-pad for a mid-battle swap, which sort of slows down the pace. Mapping the weapon menu to a rear button neatly resolves this. Much nicer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I also revisited the remastered version of <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em>—you know, the one with the damn digital movement controls that completely wreck the experience, which I will never shut up about. It hardly requires fast button combos (outside of a few sequences) or really even needs a back button; but the shape of the Split Pad Compact fits so much better in my hands that reading through its endless gray text boxes is just a more pleasant way to physically play. </p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"6468a85d895ad0a9b9b65b07f8186f50\" data-recommend-id=\"image://6468a85d895ad0a9b9b65b07f8186f50\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A Nintendo Switch with Hori Split Pad Compact controllers sits on a couple of Switch games.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"6468a85d895ad0a9b9b65b07f8186f50\" data-recommend-id=\"image://6468a85d895ad0a9b9b65b07f8186f50\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A Nintendo Switch with Hori Split Pad Compact controllers sits on a couple of Switch games.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">A few smaller, indie games have come and gone during my time with the Split Pad Compact. I also put in more time with <em>Metroid Dread</em>. The added hand real estate of the slightly larger Hori controller just made it more enjoyable. My Switch feels like a mini Steam Deck now, as opposed to the more horizontal phablet experience the stock Joy-Cons make for.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I’m not always using the Hori’s advanced features, like turbo and the rear buttons, but what I am doing is playing my damn Switch. Regularly even!</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">And that simplicity, the feeling of these things just sort of getting out of your way so you can have a more comfortable experience on the Switch is the best part of this new controller. (Oh, and in case you’re wondering, yes, according to Hori, these work on both the original Switch and OLED models). The inherent limitations of zero rumble support, no wireless functionality, and no motion sensing will be clear deal breakers in many cases. But if, like me, you’ve found the Switch something of an ergonomic horrorshow, you might find the Hori Split Pad Compact a pretty great excuse to start playing it again, even if you just want to catch up on the many hits this console’s enjoyed in your absence. </p>', '2024-01-10 16:37:48', '2024-01-10 16:37:48', 'The Next Time You\'re Looking For New Switch Joy-Con, Check These Out', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/f68a38521d4c94e2b8aa702c38fc2d1d.jpg', 'controllers', 'https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-joy-con-hori-controller-gamepad-zelda-1849601824', 'My Nintendo Switch largely sat unplayed for the duration of the pandemic.

Meanwhile, the regular official gamepads tend to go for about $60 brand new. You might be wondering if you can save a few bucks by getting something a little south of that number. Or you might be interested in trying out more modern pro controller features like assignable rear buttons and adjustable trigger ranges, but aren’t yet ready to spend over a hundred dollars on an Xbox Elite or Scuf controller.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">There are any number of reasons for looking into cheaper controllers, and here I’m going to lay out the pros and cons of some of the most common options out there for Xbox and PC. While the 8BitDo Ultimate Wired controller stands out as my personal favorite here, each of these might be more or less compelling to you for different reasons. The “best budget controller” title is going to come down to what your needs are.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The good news is that if you’re looking to save some money, you can in fact get a great budget gamepad on Xbox or PC. Most of the devices on this list are solid enough to use as your main controller, and any of these can serve as a suitable backup for when your main controller gives into the inevitable entropy known as “Drift.”</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But as we’re talking about budget controllers, we ought to set some expectations for the one potentially deal-breaking limitation that these all have.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If wireless is make or break for you, you’re gonna have to buy a more expensive gamepad than anything here. Wireless functionality is something that none of these controllers (even my favorite of this lot) have. Because of Microsoft’s proprietary wireless technology, that feature is limited to official Xbox controllers from Microsoft and select others. But don’t close your browser yet! I get it, we’ve been with wireless as a standard now since the Xbox 360, so why would you want to go back? Well, there are a few reasons.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If you’re a PC gamer, wireless might not be that big of a deal as your machine could be close enough for it not to matter. And while a cable certainly sucks for chilling on the couch and playing some Xbox, most of these have what I’d consider to be a sufficient amount of length for average scenarios, and the cables are certainly as long as anything you’d probably get packaged in a more expensive, wireless controller. In some cases you can purchase longer cables if you desire.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Honestly, if it’s a backup controller you’re looking for, having a reliable wired gamepad might be a decent thing to stick in a drawer for a rainy day, or spontaneous couch co-op.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Also, none of these are speciality controllers (though one does straddle the line between modern design and retro-novelty). These aren’t fighting gamepads, or retro-style ones with functions reserved for silicon dinosaurs of past generations. These all focus on the functions necessary for your average AAA game. You can play any modern game on these with all the buttons supported and few extra functions that you don’t need. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I played entirely on PC to test these gamepads out, either on games in the Xbox app or Steam. Steam is kind of like a skeleton key of controller compatibility (especially if you launch it in Big Picture mode). I had no issues with all but one of these controllers, and they are all certified to work on an Xbox console.</p>', '2024-01-10 16:37:48', '2024-01-10 16:37:48', 'The 5 Best Budget Controllers For Xbox And PC', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/cd10640b4cf433cf509e4a8393ed43bf.jpg', 'controllers', 'https://kotaku.com/xbox-pc-gamepad-turtle-beach-hyperkin-powera-hori-8bitd-1849545811', 'The current Xbox Core controller might be one of the best Microsoft has produced...', ''),

The company has <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://scufgaming.com/patents\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://scufgaming.com/patents\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an entire page of its website dedicated to its patents</a></span>. You know the Xbox Elite Controller from Microsoft? Most of the tech that makes it so elite was licensed from Scuf. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Scuf was purchased by Corsair Components in 2019, making it an integral part of Corsair’s evil gaming hardware empire, which also includes Origin PC and streaming device maker Elgato. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h174\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>What is the Scuf Instinct Pro controller? </strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://scufgaming.com/xbox-scuf-instinct\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://scufgaming.com/xbox-scuf-instinct\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Scuf Instinct Pro</a></span> is a combination wired and wireless controller designed for the PC and Xbox Series X/S consoles. It’s Scuf’s latest take on making its own Xbox Elite Wireless controller. There are actually two models of Instinct. There’s the $200 Instinct Pro, which comes with trigger stops and textured grips, and the $170 non-pro Instinct, which lacks those two features. </p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"545b3e952b3e653e5a1a1ce05d6558be\" data-recommend-id=\"image://545b3e952b3e653e5a1a1ce05d6558be\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"850\" data-height=\"600\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The rear view of the Scuf Instinct Pro controller, showing off its new back buttons. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"545b3e952b3e653e5a1a1ce05d6558be\" data-recommend-id=\"image://545b3e952b3e653e5a1a1ce05d6558be\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"850\" data-height=\"600\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The rear view of the Scuf Instinct Pro controller, showing off its new back buttons. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Both Instinct models feature four buttons on the back of the controller. Those are Scuf’s beloved patent babies. They used to be long metal paddles, but now they’re cute little buttons easily activated by your middle fingers. Beneath the battery compartment—yes, the Instinct Pro uses batteries instead of a rechargeable battery pack—there’s a button for quickly switching between three different button configuration profiles. The little silver switches beside the battery bay lock the controller’s triggers so they don’t have to travel to activate, which is nice for shooters.<br></p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"e8c8836c3965b36a8c9852b54cc704b2\" data-recommend-id=\"image://e8c8836c3965b36a8c9852b54cc704b2\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"850\" data-height=\"600\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A photo of Scuf\'s Instinct Pro with a green faceplate. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"e8c8836c3965b36a8c9852b54cc704b2\" data-recommend-id=\"image://e8c8836c3965b36a8c9852b54cc704b2\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"850\" data-height=\"600\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A photo of Scuf\'s Instinct Pro with a green faceplate. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The front of the Scuf Instinct Pro looks a lot like your standard Xbox Series X/S controller, down to the share button and the one-piece directional disc. There’s an additional dedicated mute button for headset users, which is lovely.<br></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h175\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>How does the Scuf Instinct Pro controller feel? </strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">What really sets the Scuf Instinct Pro apart from the standard Xbox Series X/S controllers is the removable faceplate. Not only does it allow for you to switch up the look of the controller with different covers and analog stick rings, you can also swap the analog sticks for different sizes and shapes. There are a couple of convex sticks included in the package, which I immediately threw away because convex sticks are garbage.<br></p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"1891274c167ee85fc1495c21a683b8ef\" data-recommend-id=\"image://1891274c167ee85fc1495c21a683b8ef\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"850\" data-height=\"600\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A photo of the Scuf Instinct Pro controller with its white faceplate removed. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"1891274c167ee85fc1495c21a683b8ef\" data-recommend-id=\"image://1891274c167ee85fc1495c21a683b8ef\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"850\" data-height=\"600\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A photo of the Scuf Instinct Pro controller with its white faceplate removed. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Aside from those groovy little back buttons, the Scuf Instinct Pro controller feels like an official Xbox controller with a textured grip. The form factor is pretty much the same as my standard Xbox Series X/S game pads. Despite its modular design, the Instinct Pro has a nice, solid feel to it. The weight is nice. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I was worried the little buttons on the back wouldn’t be as satisfying as the metal paddles from older Scuf models or Microsoft’s Elite Wireless Controller, but they’re actually decent and unobtrusive. You can feel them there, but they don’t feel like they’re in the way. </p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h176\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Is the Scuf Instinct Pro controller better than the standard Xbox Series X/S controller? </strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If you’re looking for extra features, more buttons, and customization options, the Instinct Pro has the original Xbox Series X/S controller beat hands down. If you don’t need any of those things, the standard controller should do you just fine.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h177\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Is the Scuf Instinct Pro controller better than the Elite Wireless 2 controller?</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This is a much tougher call. For one, Microsoft’s Elite Wireless 2 costs $20 less than the $200 Instinct Pro. The Elite Wireless 2 has multiple hair trigger stops as opposed to the Instinct Pro’s, which are either on or off. And the Elite Wireless 2 has adjustable analog stick tension, which the Instinct Pro does not. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"16b38679c6f4c8b3fcac3edda8dd5376\" data-recommend-id=\"image://16b38679c6f4c8b3fcac3edda8dd5376\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A photo of the Scuf Instinct Pro controller in a giant, mutant hand. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"16b38679c6f4c8b3fcac3edda8dd5376\" data-recommend-id=\"image://16b38679c6f4c8b3fcac3edda8dd5376\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A photo of the Scuf Instinct Pro controller in a giant, mutant hand. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">That said, I do prefer the little nubby buttons on the back of the Instinct Pro, and my custom faceplate is so much prettier than the Elite Wireless 2. If you want to make a statement with your controller, the Instinct Pro is the way to go.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h178\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Should you buy the Scuf Instinct Pro controller?</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Look folks, I am not going to tell you what to do with your money. If it were up to me you’d be spending it all on transforming robots from Japan shipped directly to my front door. What I will say is that if you drop $200 on Scuf’s fancy new Xbox Series X/S and/or PC controller, I do not think you will be disappointed. It’s a solid pro-grade controller that feels like something Microsoft might make, and not just because Scuf owns most of the patents on what Microsoft makes anyway. </p>', '2024-01-10 16:37:48', '2024-01-10 16:37:48', 'The Scuf Instinct Pro Feels Like An Official Xbox Controller', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/dd8d98f5c587b2286cac7b35a28248da.jpg', 'controllers', 'https://kotaku.com/the-scuf-instinct-pro-feels-like-an-official-xbox-contr-1847553968', 'Since 2011, Scuf Gaming has made a name for itself by producing some of the high...', '');

The bumpers color, which can be chosen individually on the Colorware website, is “Candy Apple Gloss.” That’s three of the 32 different colors Colorware offers in both matte and gloss. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"hr0agqdsemqt4wt2utfp\" data-recommend-id=\"image://hr0agqdsemqt4wt2utfp\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1200\" data-height=\"675\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"hr0agqdsemqt4wt2utfp\" data-recommend-id=\"image://hr0agqdsemqt4wt2utfp\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1200\" data-height=\"675\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Once colors are selected, Colorware takes a pair of official Nintendo Joy-Cons and paints them. These are not flimsy third-party shells—they are Nintendo hardware with a little something extra. Compared to unpainted Joy-Cons, they feel slightly thicker and quite smoother. Due to the thickness of the added paint they fit to the Switch more snugly, making the system feel more solid in handheld mode. The bumpers are lovely but incredibly tight, which is fine because eventually I will lose them in a drawer.<br></p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"l3umyizirldd29uklihl\" data-recommend-id=\"image://l3umyizirldd29uklihl\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"900\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"l3umyizirldd29uklihl\" data-recommend-id=\"image://l3umyizirldd29uklihl\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"900\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If choosing between a ton of different colors and gloss levels is too difficult, Colorware also offers a variety of limited edition Joy-Cons, as well as fully-painted Switch consoles.

Meanwhile, on consoles, we get this. </p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"xplgd1zxcxzcmbauf5q8\" data-recommend-id=\"image://xplgd1zxcxzcmbauf5q8\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"1200\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"xplgd1zxcxzcmbauf5q8\" data-recommend-id=\"image://xplgd1zxcxzcmbauf5q8\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"1200\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The LEDs in the Afterglow Wireless Deluxe Controller do not react to my on-screen actions. They don’t flash when Scorbunny evolves into Raboot. They don’t dim when I am approaching a trainer battle. They do cycle, and they can be set to any number of colors using the unit’s function and shoulder buttons. They can even be switched off, revealing a lovely, well-built, translucent skeleton of a controller. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"z6urrd3rbnurs8ycfsbk\" data-recommend-id=\"image://z6urrd3rbnurs8ycfsbk\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"900\" data-height=\"675\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"z6urrd3rbnurs8ycfsbk\" data-recommend-id=\"image://z6urrd3rbnurs8ycfsbk\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"900\" data-height=\"675\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Unlike many third-party wireless controllers for the Switch, the Afterglow supports motion control, though not any sort of rumble. The back of the unit features a pair of programmable paddles, additional buttons that can be quickly mapped to any other button on the controller on the fly. The controller’s 20-hour battery life means I can have a randomly glowing piece of hardware on my desk for a nice long time before having to plug it in for more hot glowing action. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But really, I’m just here for the glow.

Often there’s an assumption that a review will be a spoiler-free assessment of whether or not something is worth your time, keeping its distance and speaking in broad generalities. But sometimes, you need to engage with what a work is really doing in order to say anything meaningful about it, and I don’t think talking around the specifics of <em>Slay the Princess </em>will do it justice. Anyway, I pretty much already did that already when I <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/slay-the-princess-demo-pax-east-steam-black-tabby-games-1850269750\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/slay-the-princess-demo-pax-east-steam-black-tabby-games-1850269750\">previewed the game earlier this year</a></span>. So if you want to know if you should play <em>Slay the Princess</em>, the answer is yes. If you want to know why, read on.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy\" data-recommend-id=\"image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"88\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy\" data-recommend-id=\"image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"88\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Slay the Princess </em>appears pretty single-minded in the beginning. You’re thrust into a situation with no context, walking through a forest toward a cabin where a princess who allegedly will destroy the world is being kept at bay by a single chain around her wrist. It’s up to you to slay her and save everyone. You’re told all this by a narrator who refuses to elaborate on some of the most basic information. How is she going to destroy the world? Does she even want to? Does her apparent capability to destroy the world mean she must die?</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">All of these questions spin through my head as I enter the cabin. There’s a knife sitting on a table, but little else hints at my grim task until I descend the stairs and find the princess chained up. I had already tried to talk to her in the original demo, so I thought I’d shake up my strategy this time and not entertain having a conversation at all. Instead, I walked right up to her, used the blade I’d picked up on the way in, and stabbed her without hesitation. Then I made the mistake of removing the blade, and she stabbed me with her own weapon. As we both bled out on the floor of the dungeon, we were caught in the loop of our creator’s design.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"dcc68f2082c4163d1384cb7b058e864b\" data-recommend-id=\"image://dcc68f2082c4163d1384cb7b058e864b\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\'The Princess stands with a missing hand.

The narrator says \"Free from her bindings, the Princess turns to face you, her fierce gaze meeting your eye.\"\' data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I wake up back outside the cabin, with the narrator once again telling me I must slay the princess and save the world. Every question I ask about the apparent loop I’m in sparks more confusion between me, the narrator, and the literal voices in my head. But nevertheless, I head back into the cabin and find it’s not quite as I remember it. There’s a mirror on the wall that disappears when I try to look into it, the stairwell isn’t quite as I remember it, and the princess has evolved into a monstrous version of herself. This loop repeats itself, with the princess appearing in different, terrifying forms each time, until the princess and I find ourselves in a strange pocket dimension between the loops, able to talk without the narrator there to tell us what to do.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In this in-between space, <em>Slay the Princess</em> gets existential. The princess is essentially absorbing each variation of her we meet in these time loops to find new understanding. Each possibility is a different version of who she could be based on the slightest alterations to how I reach her in the dungeon. She acknowledges that each version of her is <em>her</em>, but by experiencing all these realities, she is able to gain a greater understanding of who she is and who she can be. She grows beyond what the narrator has told her she is, but acknowledges that certain parts of her are inherent, and others are determined by what happens to her in a loop.</p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Slay the Princess\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"slay-the-princess\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">She asks that I continue to go through the loop to bring her new perspectives, and so I do it. I pick different dialogue options that determine which version of the princess I’ll find in the dungeon, and by the end, I’d brought her so many variants that she had transcended the understanding the narrator had spouted off at the beginning of each cycle. Even if I wasn’t mesmerized by the existentialism and stellar prose of Black Tabby Games’ writing, the reveal of what kind of horrific monstrosity the princess would appear as on each loop was motivation enough to keep running down the stairs into the dungeon again and again.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Sometimes the princess would just appear as a very tall version of herself towering over me, while at others she would be a vicious, blade-bearing terror. There was even a time when she’d taken the form of animals, circling around me in the darkness as if I were her prey. Sometimes I slayed her, other times she slayed me. Eventually, however, as her understanding grew, the narrator’s control over the situation shattered– literally, as the mirror that kept appearing between loops broke, showing pieces of this previously unseen figure’s appearance in its cracked shards. Though the image is broken, I’m able to see that the narrator is bird-like, and is apparently responsible for the creation of the princess, who is meant to embody destruction, death, and the rebirth that comes after.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"c9fa3fcc8cc239d778b49690d73f48ff\" data-recommend-id=\"image://c9fa3fcc8cc239d778b49690d73f48ff\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\'The narrator speaks through a shattered mirror, saying \"Because among other things, she is death itself.

If death is a frightening, debilitating concept to you, the princess becomes a monster. If you approach it without fear, she will appear as an approachable human being. Thus the multiversal cycle we find ourselves in now. The simulation the narrator has put us in means we can follow every permutation to its natural conclusion, but now that the princess is aware of what she is, there’s a new conundrum. If she is allowed to exist as the god of destruction she was designed to be, she can escape this construct and lay waste to the outside world.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">With the mirror that embodied him broken, the narrator is not long for this world, and you interrogating him in his final moments makes for <em>Slay the Princess</em>’ most memorable scene. As you ask each question, pieces of the mirror you’re looking at disappear, taking the narrator with it. I quickly realize I have more dialogue options than pieces of the mirror, and the stakes of each question I choose to ask grow much higher. There’s no time to get too inquisitive, as I only have a limited amount of time with the game’s info dump. But as I talk to him, it becomes very clear the narrator has a specific vision of who the princess is, and who I should be. He spends the entire conversation warning me about the dangers of an entity he created that has long been shaped by others’ perceptions of her. As far as he’s concerned, her existence, the threat of death and destruction, is what keeps people from being without fear. Is her life worth a burdenless existence for the rest of the world?<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I can ask all the questions I want, but in the end, it will just be me and the princess here to decide what’s next. She has ascended to godhood, and I can either leave this simulation with her as gods and play out what the narrator feared, or you can rewind the entire scenario, and talk to each other as a princess in a dungeon and her would-be assassin and choose to leave it as people, rather than gods.<br></p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"fb39fd5569795242ede2bf466a0c5b9d\" data-recommend-id=\"image://fb39fd5569795242ede2bf466a0c5b9d\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The Princess\' true form, made up of multiple iterations of her grafted onto her body, says &quot;I can finally see you, and you can finally see me.&quot;\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"fb39fd5569795242ede2bf466a0c5b9d\" data-recommend-id=\"image://fb39fd5569795242ede2bf466a0c5b9d\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The Princess\' true form, made up of multiple iterations of her grafted onto her body, says &quot;I can finally see you, and you can finally see me.&quot;\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">There’s a lot of minutiae in the space between <em>Slay the Princess</em>’ multiple endings, but while much of the conversation around Black Tabby Games’ visual novel is around the various, monstrous forms the princess takes in each loop, all I can think about is this final cycle. Whichever sequences of events you choose to follow, it’s here that you and the princess finally see each other for what you actually are. This is both as gods meant to embody ideas, but also as people, long-beholden to the views of your creator, and the hypothetical threats you pose to the people outside this construct.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Slay the Princess </em>is all about time loops, mind-bending twists, and terrifying character design, but at its center, it is about being seen for who you really are, rather than what can be summed up in a second-hand account of what you’re perceived to be. The first time I played through the ending, I chose to have the princess and I leave the construct as gods, believing death was part of the human experience that makes life worth living. But after replaying it, I chose to find the princess in her chains once again, and to free her from the cycle entirely, leaving as ourselves.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This world we live in is so often depersonalizing, feeling dismissive of everything we individually want and believe ourselves to be, as we’re so often in the vice grip of what others want or believe us to be. Our employers try to quantify our usefulness on spreadsheets and we seek validation from strangers to tell ourselves we are worthy of love, all of which contribute to a distorted and potentially false reflection of who we are, what we believe, and our own self-worth. The way others view us defines our day-to-day, but only if we let it.<br></p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"b4c7f2386f7851db4ad454fd5cc22859\" data-recommend-id=\"image://b4c7f2386f7851db4ad454fd5cc22859\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The princess approaches the exit to the cabin.

It should be so cathartic to play a game where you can remove yourself from a cycle like this, but it only makes me wish it felt possible to be so clearly understood and free from the shackles of others’ visions of who you are in the real world. <em>Slay the Princess </em>instills hope in me that such freedom exists and despair at just how tired I am in equal measure. But at least it makes me believe in possibilities, even if they might take a few loops to see to the end.</p>', '2024-01-10 16:47:01', '2024-01-10 16:47:01', 'You Need To Play This Brilliant New Time-Loop Horror Game', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/503d61a0cfdcec8caa216a2ea0aed590.jpg', 'pc', 'https://kotaku.com/slay-the-princess-review-black-tabby-games-horror-1851000305', 'I’m not interested in just vaguely gesturing at what Slay the Princess, a horror...', ''),

The first part makes <em>Holstin</em>’s target atmosphere obvious, trapping you in 1992 Poland, in a small, wood-paneled home made more smothering by occasional crashes of thunder coming from outside. The house has been overtaken by a mysterious <em>ooze</em>—patches of tumored, flesh-pink tendrils that deplete your health if you touch them, but retreat once you turn on the lights.<br></p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h80053\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><em><strong>Holstin</strong></em><strong> offers a 3D puzzle</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You, a man with deep frown lines, don’t know what’s happening.

I rotate the isometric camera to find more secrets in its eight possible angles, like obscured entryways or helpful lamp locations.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This can occasionally be frustrating (like when I couldn’t click on an important item until fiddling with the camera for a good five minutes) and, for me, often nauseating—games easily make me motion sick.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But I can imagine horror game enthusiasts less prone to dizzy spells and more efficient at solving puzzles will find the camera design uniquely engaging.

In my case, it was the <em>GameSpot </em>forums of the early 2000s. There, I found people I could share my love of games with, as well as get into deep discussions and sometimes heated debates about the state of the world. It was a place where I could explore myself in ways that I couldn’t in the “real world,” and for a period of my life, it was essential to my existence. The new game <em>Videoverse </em>takes place in a fictional online community in late 2003, but creator Kinmoku Games (who were also behind <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/video-game-about-a-one-night-stand-is-as-awkward-as-it-1788830186\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/video-game-about-a-one-night-stand-is-as-awkward-as-it-1788830186\">2016’s excellent <em>One Night Stand</em></a></span>) imbues it with so much authenticity and character that it feels remarkably alive. If you once found a home in just such an online space, I suspect <em>Videoverse </em>will resonate with your memories of the internet as it once was. And if you didn’t, there’s enough tenderness and humanity to <em>Videoverse</em>’s world to make it a worthwhile glimpse into experiences you never had.<br></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h75979\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>The way we were</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Videoverse </em>takes place almost entirely within the titular online community, a collection of message boards frequented by owners of the fictional Kinmoku Shark. As you navigate Videoverse, you’ll spot details reminiscent of Xbox 360-era gamer profiles, as well as ads that feel true to the spirit and style of early 2000s video game advertising–al<!-- -->ways energetic, occasionally embarrassing. The in-game Videoverse draws on a hodgepodge of influences, but its closest real-life parallel is probably <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/nintendo-shut-down-the-miiverse-tonight-as-fans-said-fi-1820241055\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/nintendo-shut-down-the-miiverse-tonight-as-fans-said-fi-1820241055\">Miiverse, the now-defunct online community Nintendo created alongside its own ill-fated Wii U</a></span>. Like Miiverse, the fictional Videoverse sports communities for different games, and text posts that people write exist alongside art drawn and submitted for the approval (or derision) of their fellow users.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">And indeed, the Miiverse parallel feels apt as well because Videoverse users increasingly suspect that the service’s days may be numbered. Kinmoku has recently launched a new console, the Dolphin (I see what you did there), and there’s a feeling, growing stronger with every day, that the console maker is likely going to pull the plug on Videoverse soon, encouraging fans to upgrade to the new device and its online community (which, unlike Videoverse, requires a subscription fee).</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"e9547630d9c1525399a3c0ce1b0a88b0\" data-recommend-id=\"image://e9547630d9c1525399a3c0ce1b0a88b0\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1739\" data-height=\"978\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Emmett and his friend Markus chat about the game Feudal Fantasy while smiling at each other. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"e9547630d9c1525399a3c0ce1b0a88b0\" data-recommend-id=\"image://e9547630d9c1525399a3c0ce1b0a88b0\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1739\" data-height=\"978\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Emmett and his friend Markus chat about the game Feudal Fantasy while smiling at each other. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In the midst of all this, you play as Emmett, a teenager who lives in Germany and has aspirations of becoming a video game artist. The Shark may be on its last legs (???) but it’s going out with one last hurrah, a blockbuster called <em>Feudal Fantasy</em>. Yes, its name is an obvious homage to Square Enix’s similarly named series, but <em>Feudal Fantasy </em>is also very much its own thing, and throughout the course of <em>Videoverse</em>, you’ll witness key cutscenes in this Japanese-history-inspired epic melodrama as Emmett plays through it.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Naturally, one of the most active boards on Videoverse is the one devoted to <em>Feudal Fantasy</em>, a place where Emmett and other players not only passionately discuss the game but also share fan art. Much of this art aims to capture the game’s iconic characters in moments of heightened intensity, but I particularly appreciated the more playful fan art, like those that good-naturedly ribbed the game’s lack of historical accuracy or its sometimes-awkward localization. One drawing, by Emmett’s friend Markus, shows <em>Feudal Fantasy </em>hero Hanzo<strong> </strong>holding a chocolate bar and asking, “This is feudal Japan?” while another character’s contribution shows a hamburger labeled as RAMEN.<br></p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"9e2836b00a9900a5703c50c63a3e32f8\" data-recommend-id=\"image://9e2836b00a9900a5703c50c63a3e32f8\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1739\" data-height=\"978\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"In the Feudal Fantasy community, someone has posted an image of a hamburger with the word RAMEN next to it.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"9e2836b00a9900a5703c50c63a3e32f8\" data-recommend-id=\"image://9e2836b00a9900a5703c50c63a3e32f8\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1739\" data-height=\"978\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"In the Feudal Fantasy community, someone has posted an image of a hamburger with the word RAMEN next to it.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">These are fictional details about a fictional game, of course, but they feel precise and authentic, making it easier for us to fully invest ourselves in the world of <em>Videoverse </em>and to understand the experiences of these players, even though we only view them through the window of these message boards. And <em>Videoverse </em>is full of such details. Kinmoku (the real-life devs of <em>Videoverse</em>, that is, not the fictional in-game console maker) know this cultural territory inside and out, and do an exemplary job of crafting a believable online space here.<br></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h75980\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Human connection in a digital realm</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But an online space is nothing without the people who populate it. The center of <em>Videoverse</em>’s story involves Emmett’s connection with a mysterious newcomer to the boards whose own <em>Feudal Fantasy </em>fan art leaves him awed and intrigued. As he and this person, who goes by the handle Vivi, communicate and open up to each other, Emmett learns a great deal–about his own privilege; about what he hopes to do with his future; about how much the connections that Videoverse allows him really mean, and what an impact they’ve had on his life. Kinmoku is working with themes that will resonate with many who formed meaningful online connections in their youth, and then saw the spaces that enabled those connections disappear as the internet evolved.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">That central storyline is compelling and builds up to a poignant conclusion (or at least it did in my playthrough–I think there are a few possible endings depending on the choices you make). But it’s the supporting ensemble of names and faces you encounter all over the boards, and the little heartwarming exchanges, the silly bits of chit-chat and video game in-jokes, and the fierce disputes they all engage in, that really make the game sing. More than once I was struck by revelations or personality clashes I witnessed that made me feel like I’d stepped right back into my own bygone forum days. Sometimes, a person will offer up a hint of some trouble happening in their home life or some other struggle they’re experiencing, and I really felt for them.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"71f177bb4bd97312dc29714fdf0493d1\" data-recommend-id=\"image://71f177bb4bd97312dc29714fdf0493d1\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1739\" data-height=\"978\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"In a reference to Majora\'s Mask, a giant moon with a spooky face is seen looking down in a piece of art on the &quot;art corner community&quot; board, along with the words NOT MUCH TIME.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"71f177bb4bd97312dc29714fdf0493d1\" data-recommend-id=\"image://71f177bb4bd97312dc29714fdf0493d1\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1739\" data-height=\"978\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"In a reference to Majora\'s Mask, a giant moon with a spooky face is seen looking down in a piece of art on the &quot;art corner community&quot; board, along with the words NOT MUCH TIME.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Online connections can be strange, can’t they? The way you can feel simultaneously close and distant, understanding that what appears to you as just a name on a screen is a person with their own life and their own hardships, all of which exist beyond the bounds of the space you share. You can tell that the makers of <em>Videoverse </em>really gave some thought to who each of these forum posters are as people—they each have their own voice, their own interests, and sometimes their own challenges, which you can respond to with sensitivity and support, or disdain if you prefer.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You shape Emmett’s personality by choosing possible responses to posts on the boards from a few different options. I never felt too limited by this–there was usually an option that mirrored my own reactions closely enough, and when, in certain interactions, a choice was unavailable to me because my Emmett was “not cocky enough,” I always felt, “Yep, that’s right, my Emmett definitely would not say that!” You can also interact with the boards by doing things like customizing your avatar, and reporting posts that exist just to attack and antagonize other users.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">And, of course, there are some real jerks on Videoverse, as there usually are in such spaces–people who spout sexist crap or other repugnant nonsense. As Emmett, I took some satisfaction in reporting them and trying to keep Videoverse safe and welcoming for everyone. Doing stuff like this does net you some neat little in-game rewards, like new options for customizing your Videoverse avatar and new color themes for the message boards, but I was mostly motivated by the fact that Videoverse felt real to me and I just wanted it to be a place where people would want to spend time. I don’t know how deep this goes, but I definitely got the sense that how you choose to moderate the boards and how you treat others can have an impact on how Videoverse evolves over the course of the story.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"2afdb5ad292a912fce1b6bca4e4c1f21\" data-recommend-id=\"image://2afdb5ad292a912fce1b6bca4e4c1f21\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1739\" data-height=\"978\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\'A user named GlitterGirl asks for help in a game.

A clear nod to all those rumors that seem to come from someone having <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/your-uncle-who-worked-at-nintendo-still-had-to-pay-for-1822284288\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/your-uncle-who-worked-at-nintendo-still-had-to-pay-for-1822284288\">“an uncle who works at Nintendo”</a></span> or wherever, UncleFromKinmoku loves to drop vague, ominous predictions on the boards. Is he just yanking everybody’s chain, or does he really have the inside scoop? Without spoiling anything, I’ll say that trying to figure out his whole deal was very enjoyable, and the results elegantly served as another thread in <em>Videoverse</em>’s thematic concerns with the passage of time and with what we sometimes lose as companies “improve” their products and make things obsolete.<br></p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h75981\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>All yesterday’s parties</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Supporting all this emotional and thematic texture are the game’s engaging visuals. Naturally, as a game set on an early 2000s message board, <em>Videoverse </em>is hardly pushing state-of-the-art graphics, but what it does have is beautiful, authentic-feeling visual design. The aforementioned ads and fan art you see around the boards are bursting with personality, and each artist posting to the boards has their own art style, just as each person has their own distinct voice. Additionally, Emmett and his friends have a nifty accessory for the console called a Shark Cam, which often lets us see their faces as they text-chat. Kinmoku once again displays the same knack for expressive artwork that they showed off in <em>One Night Stand</em>, and seeing Emmett break into laughter or furrow his brow in concern as he chats with Vivi or other friends lends the text exchanges more emotional life.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Everything ends. But we take something from the times and places we’ve left behind and carry it with us as we move forward in life. I know that the countless hours I spent on forums in the early 2000s weren’t time wasted but a crucial part of my development as a person. I probably wouldn’t be here right now if it hadn’t been for those experiences. <em>Videoverse </em>is a beautiful exploration of how the online spaces we inhabit and the connections we form in them can shape our lives as much as anything.</p>', '2024-01-10 16:47:01', '2024-01-10 16:47:01', 'This New Game Is A Great Tribute To Early Online Gaming Communities', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/bc841dc14ac194a1e5756d38ac6919ed.jpg', 'pc', 'https://kotaku.com/videoverse-game-review-online-gaming-forums-vn-kinmoku-1850780173', 'Many people who grew up with the internet had formative experiences in communiti...', ''),

You control a lone commander on horseback and set about building up a small kingdom while fending off waves of increasingly difficult enemies. It starts out simply enough, but new enemy types and increasingly complex maps add new hurdles for you to overcome. So far I’ve finished the tutorial and first two maps, and am absolutely in love with it. </p>\n\n\n<section class=\"sc-q35npn-0 eNnFZk\">\n</section>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">There are only three factors to manage—gold, upgrades, and soldiers. During the day you visit nodes on the map to choose what to spend your gold on building. New houses and farms will earn more gold, while walls, watchtowers, and barracks will improve your defenses. It seem simple at first, but the streamlined economics offer just enough interesting trade-offs to make you think without turning every round into a mini deathmarch of planning and number crunching.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"b1fbbdfe71416a88d956a4c3446b6501\" data-recommend-id=\"image://b1fbbdfe71416a88d956a4c3446b6501\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A GIF shows different maps. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"b1fbbdfe71416a88d956a4c3446b6501\" data-recommend-id=\"image://b1fbbdfe71416a88d956a4c3446b6501\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A GIF shows different maps. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">For example, you’ll want to spend most of your gold on buildings that generate revenue early on so you can start compounding your earnings. Leave yourself too defenseless, however, and you’ll get easily overrun. Barracks and archery ranges, meanwhile, let you choose which types of units to recruit. Knights are armored but slow, while pikemen are faster and have higher damage. Crossbow units are strong but short range, while ones with long bows can hit enemies that are farther away. Once you select which route to go, you’re locked in, making it important to plan for the future without getting bogged down in tons of possibilities.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">At night, you face off against mobs made up of all different unit types coming from multiple directions. Your armies will target whatever’s closest or you can marshall them around in small groups by walking up to them, clicking, and then having them follow you somewhere else. Your commander will also attack, take damage, and buff nearby units if certain upgrades are unlocked. That’s the extent of your moment-to-moment impact during fights, and it provides a nice balance between the micro-management of a full-blown real time strategy game and the completely hands-off approach of some city builders.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The nicest thing about<em> Thronefall </em>is its upkeep. Units are slowly replenished for free as they die, and buildings that are destroyed automatically get resurrected at full health the next day. The only penalty is that they won’t generate more money for you if they were destroyed the round prior. Otherwise there’s no real negative consequence for getting completely steamrolled as long as you keep your central castle intact. In addition to cutting out a ton of tedium, it also reduces the anxiety and frustration associated with wasting resources. <em>Thronefall </em>focuses more on rewarding you for making smart decisions rather than punishing you for the bad ones. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"3fa7c04d659aa86905191bcd8890f775\" data-recommend-id=\"image://3fa7c04d659aa86905191bcd8890f775\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A GIF shows collecting money in the game. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"3fa7c04d659aa86905191bcd8890f775\" data-recommend-id=\"image://3fa7c04d659aa86905191bcd8890f775\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A GIF shows collecting money in the game. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">“Getting older and caught in the usual swamp of work and responsibilities, we realized we don’t have the 100 hours to sink into the next super-complex game anymore,” Grizzly Games’ Paul Schnepf told <em>Game Developer</em> <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/mastering-minimalism-and-layering-complexity-with-strategy-game-thronefall\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/mastering-minimalism-and-layering-complexity-with-strategy-game-thronefall\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">in an interview</a></span>. “We felt there was a need for wholesome and deep, but also less time-consuming, experiences.”<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I’ve enjoyed how breezy the game is, but I can definitely see the difficulty and complexity ramping up a bit further in. As you play you unlock additional perks that you can choose between at the start of each map, like whether to arm your commander with a spear or bow, or whether to increase your money generation or get bonus health for your castle.

Despite the years of waiting, it feels like a rough first draft that needs more work. Set in a kingdom thrust into civil war over a succession crisis and royal family in-fighting, it follows two romantically involved soldiers, Vashti and Desmond, onto the battlefield as their conflicting loyalties and principles threaten to unravel their lives. Every scene is rendered with beautiful sprites reminiscent of Square Enix’s classic, and each new plot point is punctuated by a turn-based fight on a chessboard-like grid between competing squads of archers, medics, magicians and knights.</p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"5704418bd103d18e7eeec561c5a3241a\" data-recommend-id=\"image://5704418bd103d18e7eeec561c5a3241a\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A GIF shows combat in Arcadia Atlas. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"5704418bd103d18e7eeec561c5a3241a\" data-recommend-id=\"image://5704418bd103d18e7eeec561c5a3241a\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A GIF shows combat in Arcadia Atlas. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I’ve played about four hours so far, and the story can be compelling when it doesn’t feel barebones or clumsy. Star-crossed lovers thrust into the chaos of a civil war is a fine crucible for interrogating what makes characters tick and how far they’re willing to go to fight for what matters most to them, even if the dialogue sometimes feels undercooked, “Listen, I’m not happy about it either, but you know how much dark magic damaged my village,” Desmond tells Vashti early on. “As much as I hate to say it, he has to be put to death.”<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But the real issue with <em>Arcadian Atlas </em>is that it’s a chore to navigate and play, and there’s no real creativity or depth in its RPG systems to make battles exciting or make it satisfying to grow and level up your crew. Skill trees are brief and mostly revolve around earning damage upgrades. There are a dozen unique job classes, but you can’t mix and match abilities. Combat also heavily favors ranged units, which have good damage output and little risk of ever missing their target.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"2353550b74c45139a07e872fd530c42b\" data-recommend-id=\"image://2353550b74c45139a07e872fd530c42b\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2880\" data-height=\"1620\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot shows the roster menu. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"2353550b74c45139a07e872fd530c42b\" data-recommend-id=\"image://2353550b74c45139a07e872fd530c42b\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2880\" data-height=\"1620\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot shows the roster menu. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The battlefield also feels wonky and incomplete. Animations for unit movement and attacks don’t feel fluid, and terrain has no real impact on strategy. Fireballs and arrows can pass through obstacles and comrades unimpeded, while melee units can strike anyone next to them no matter how much higher or lower the adjacent squares are. It makes for very unbalanced encounters with little in the way of tactical trade-offs to consider or competing priorities to weigh.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In isolation, none of these shortcomings would be that big of an issue, but taken together they slowly add up to a simplistic and tedious experience that’s hard to recommend to even the genre’s biggest fans. Eventually even the mildest frustrations become hard to ignore, like having to press the accept button to progress every finished loading screen, and the fact that navigating the battlefield grid requires repeatedly flicking the thumbstick on the gamepad rather than simply holding it. The game supports mouse and keyboard as well, but I actually found the cursor controls to be even more finicky and sticky.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">One of the few points of pleasure for me in each battle was the soundtrack. Instead of dramatic horns and violins, <em>Arcadian Atlas</em>’ jazz-infused soundtrack by composer Moritz P.G. Katz is dominated by saxophones and guitars. The standard combat music in particular is so oddly unexpected but catchy, I still found it playing inside my head days later. I wish I could say the rest of my time with the game felt as memorable. </p>', '2024-01-10 16:47:01', '2024-01-10 16:47:01', 'I Wish I Loved This Final Fantasy Tactics-Inspired SRPG 7 Years In The Making', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/388e1e2ace696e1b8999b0d39c53843e.jpg', 'pc', 'https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-arcadian-atlas-srpg-steam-review-1850692803', 'Final Fantasy Tactics nailed so many things so exquisitely that, despite plenty ...', ''),

With a million copies sold in its first month, this indie title from Korean developers Mintrocket crosses diving and fishing with running a restaurant, and creates one of the best games we’ve seen in 2023. Here’s why.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Right now, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/livestreams/welcome.html\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/livestreams/welcome.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">is in the midst of one of its annual explorations of the sea floor</a></span>. Live-streamed on YouTube, an unmanned submersible drops down a couple of miles to the seabed, and films transects of the unexplored regions, as informed and excited scientists explain everything we’re seeing. Sometimes, if you’re very lucky, you’ll see them discovering a brand new species of peculiar deep-sea life, at which point (if they see enough of them to be sure it’s not the last of its kind) it’s very likely you’ll watch a remote-operated vacuum sloooooop up the little creature, for them to study up top. I am entirely unaware if they ever eat them.<br></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I tell you all this because it’s with these fascinating explorations playing on my second monitor that I’ve been playing the absolutely wonderful <em>Dave The Diver</em>, in which I am making my own underwater explorations, attempting to gather new species of fish, in order to…serve them up in a sushi restaurant Dave is co-running with an odd chap called Cobra, and a wunder-chef called Bancho. It’s a very similar endeavor, just with slightly differing goals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Think of <em>Dave The Diver</em> as the aquatic version of <em>Moonlighter</em>, Digital Sun’s charming action-RPG in which you delve into dungeons by night, collecting loot that you then sell at your shop the next day. Forgoing that game’s fantasy trappings, <em>Dave </em>is a pixel-based RPG in which you alternate between diving into a mysterious, ever-changing bay to catch as many fish as you can, and then helping run a bustling sushi restaurant that serves up your catches based on a menu you put together each evening, with a growing staff you (somewhat) manage, and a social media-savvy customer base to impress. You make money in your business to buy new equipment and increase (decrease?) the depths to which you can dive, the oxygen supply you can take with you, and the quality of your harpoon to catch bigger and more dangerous fish.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">And if that were the whole game—diving for new catches, running the restaurant to make profit, buying new equipment to explore further—it would be a winner. I’d be fulsomely recommending it to you right now, because it would be a feedback loop of enormous satisfaction and fun. But that’s not the whole game, not even a bit. <em>Dave The Diver</em> is a game that will not stop getting bigger, more interesting, and perhaps most importantly, more outright bonkers.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"0059a0ff57bdc67d2d552ec5641e5644\" data-recommend-id=\"image://0059a0ff57bdc67d2d552ec5641e5644\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2560\" data-height=\"1432\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Opening the sushi restaurant for the evening\'s service.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"0059a0ff57bdc67d2d552ec5641e5644\" data-recommend-id=\"image://0059a0ff57bdc67d2d552ec5641e5644\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2560\" data-height=\"1432\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Opening the sushi restaurant for the evening\'s service.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Introducing new features like other games introduce loading screens, <em>DTD </em>evolves continuously. At first, you’ll be focused on getting your sushi place up-and-running, serving a handful of dishes to a scant few customers a night. During your two daily dives, you’ll catch the fish you need to create new recipes and dishes, along with finding various shells, starfish, and other novelties. Oh, and weapons. Guns. Lots of underwater guns, that can’t survive the transition above the waves. But the more you play, the more characters you encounter, who want to get involved.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">There’s Duff, for instance, who will build you new, permanent guns, based on the designs of those you find, and with materials you pick up on your dives. Or there’s Ellie, who wants you to do some ecological work for spurious reasons, gathering all manner of non-fish life. And, er, Dr. Bacon, who wants your help investigating signs of a mythical underwater “sea people,” exploring ancient caves and deciphering strange runic texts. Oh, and there’s Maki, a young girl traumatized by the loss of her father who communicates through a furious glove puppet of a <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clione\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clione\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">clione</a></span> and who, in return for preparing a specific dish, will give you a fishing net for those hard-to-catch teeny creatures.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"0ac70aedbc4577d756a230aa3e96bbc3\" data-recommend-id=\"image://0ac70aedbc4577d756a230aa3e96bbc3\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2059\" data-height=\"1158\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Dave dives with some very happy dolphins.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"0ac70aedbc4577d756a230aa3e96bbc3\" data-recommend-id=\"image://0ac70aedbc4577d756a230aa3e96bbc3\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2059\" data-height=\"1158\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Dave dives with some very happy dolphins.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Yeah, it’s nuts. Brilliantly so. Even after many, many hours, the game is still chucking entirely new elements at me thick and fast. There comes a point where you’ll be certain you’ve got the bulk of the game by now, especially with its later addition of night fishing, when it suddenly introduces an entire fish farm, complete with breeding program, and a storyline for its host, Otto, about a long-lost missing son. There are other, far more ridiculous story elements that I’m not sharing because they’re much more fun to discover for yourself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Importantly, the two core elements work very well. The fishing, which is how you’ll spend most of your time when playing, is about swimming the portly Dave ever-deeper into this inexplicable bay that changes its geology every time you explore. Along the way, you’ll harpoon all manner of fish, using all manner of strange harpoons (electric, say, or most confusingly, flammable), and an ever-growing arsenal of guns, used to weaken the large, stronger fish before you try to catch them. Many fish are predatory, and will attempt to munch on Dave, including some sizeable and furious sharks. Dave’s health is entirely represented by the amount of oxygen he has remaining, with attacks knocking off huge chunks. O2 is frequently replenished via underwater sources, but running out means a brush with death, and a rescue that only allows you to retrieve a single object you’ve picked up or fished on that dive.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The better your equipment, the further and deeper you’re able to explore, which opens up new arrays of fish to catch, and often more dangerous fish to battle. At the same time, a dive might have you facing off against a gang of underwater pirates, or some other surprise twist. On some occasions you’ll want to do a straight fishing trip, building up stocks for the restaurant, and avoiding the greater dangers. On others, you might try to reach a new depth, or complete a specific quest, without gathering too much you wouldn’t want to lose should you fail.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"4d772eafd5fa8b787cd6b24eb350a89e\" data-recommend-id=\"image://4d772eafd5fa8b787cd6b24eb350a89e\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1867\" data-height=\"1050\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Duff works on one of his weapon creations.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"4d772eafd5fa8b787cd6b24eb350a89e\" data-recommend-id=\"image://4d772eafd5fa8b787cd6b24eb350a89e\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1867\" data-height=\"1050\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Duff works on one of his weapon creations.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Then there’s the sushi place. Your job is theoretically “manager,” but in reality it’s “dogsbody.” Poor Dave. At first you need to do <em>everything</em> except for the cooking. That means pouring green tea, bussing tables, and clearing up empty dishes, all without customers getting upset at tardiness. Dave is not a thin chap, and like the mighty penguin, while superb underwater, isn’t the best on land. So you’ll soon be able to hire staff, even train them, to keep up with the growing popularity of the business.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Here too there are surprise twists, absolutely daft customers coming in with specific requests, for whom you will need to catch specific fish to meet their whims. So many elements of the restaurant are accompanied by <em>hilarious</em> mini-cutscenes, animated montages of new recipes being discovered, or customers’ experience of ecstatic pleasure at tasting their required dish.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">And yet as much as I describe, <em>Dave The Diver</em> is doing so much more! It’s never overwhelming, thankfully, with the bustle of an evening’s service the most frantic element at play. The rest allows you to play things out at your own pace, a dive lasting as long as you can make it, without nagging you to get back. You can expect dives to last a solid 20 minutes each by the time you’re a few hours in, always with something new to do, somewhere new to reach, or some madcap quest to complete.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Then within this, every element is delivered with such glee. Its relatively simple opening belies an intricate game that’s more RPG than anything else, each aspect delightfully detailed and refined. If there’s any weakness, it’s that occasionally the Korean game’s English could be <em>slightly</em> tighter, but even this feels ridiculously nit-picky.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"d74dd32fb815f4d3ec6651b5f10f2ac9\" data-recommend-id=\"image://d74dd32fb815f4d3ec6651b5f10f2ac9\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2560\" data-height=\"1432\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Social media in Dave the Diver.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"d74dd32fb815f4d3ec6651b5f10f2ac9\" data-recommend-id=\"image://d74dd32fb815f4d3ec6651b5f10f2ac9\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2560\" data-height=\"1432\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Social media in Dave the Diver.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Dave The Diver</em> very much deserves the enormous success it’s received in its first month, selling over a million copies, and hopefully making developers Mintrocket enormously rich.

Mita, the blue-haired, diamond-eyed protagonist of the mobile game I play, requests I put her dirty clothes away, cook her chicken soup, and earn money through mini-games over a series of fast-track days.<br></p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"55c14e26a72660dee84c47ffe9a4d502\" data-recommend-id=\"image://55c14e26a72660dee84c47ffe9a4d502\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3780\" data-height=\"2124\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The anime protagonist of MiSide closes her eyes against a pink background.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"55c14e26a72660dee84c47ffe9a4d502\" data-recommend-id=\"image://55c14e26a72660dee84c47ffe9a4d502\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3780\" data-height=\"2124\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The anime protagonist of MiSide closes her eyes against a pink background.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The point-and-click intro is a bit clunky, like when it cuts to a “Day 5” title card before I get the chance to make any soup, but its design and art style is lipstick-smooth and cohesive. I appreciate the attention to detail, like Mita’s satisfaction meter in the top-left corner, and her funny imploring to “Remember! You can play [mini-games] to get money.” It makes me feel like I’m about to play a knowing parody of the stalker woman trope, a <em>Fatal Attraction</em> spurred by G-Fuel, but then it starts falling apart.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Mita tells me to put my phone down, and when I do, I’ve seemingly been transported into her game, finding myself inside a 3D, explorable version of the house depicted in the 2D introduction. I walk through it in first-person to observe more amusing details—a book on the shelf titled “How to Tease Him,” a small doll with red eyes that follow me around Mita’s peach-pink room—that, again, demonstrate pleasant artistic sensibility. I like the soundtrack, too; it’s a sorrowful new-age synth loop that detunes whenever something extra scary happens, like when the electricity suddenly gives out.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s also around this point that the game’s logic starts breaking down. After Mita appears in the anime-style flesh, dialogue prompts to learn more about how I entered her game and why only make me more confused. Asking outright about what happened triggers a black screen while Mita presumably explains, and when the game cuts back to her she declares “And here you are!” like I have any idea of what she said. Other dialogue that should give me goosebumps ends up being similarly frustrating, like when I ask her why she requested I hand her a pair of scissors during dinner.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">“I can also open the sauce with a knife, of course,” Mita says, “But I wanted to have everything ready for your return, so you can’t see the long preparations. I love making surprises! Yeeep.” Well, no one promised me she would be the most coherent virtual girlfriend.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The demo ends shortly after this. While we’re playing a card game, my protagonist hears a thumping sound coming from Mita’s closet. Mita stops him from prying it open, citing her private underwear stash, then addresses his anxiety with something that makes me sad: “This world…it’s just these four rooms. Wouldn’t that be enough for you? Will you just try to stay with me?”<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">When it’s time for me to reply, “stay” is, confoundingly, a locked dialogue option. The game seems to resist thinking too hard about the implications of its own story—how lonely a girl must become if she’s stuck inside a phone, always needing more but never able to get it on her own terms—and instead hopes that players think a devoted woman is scary enough by herself.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Even still, <em>MiSide</em> doesn’t brush its isolated woman with either <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://jezebel.com/single-white-female-or-unmarried-karen-1844792703\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://jezebel.com/single-white-female-or-unmarried-karen-1844792703\"><em>Single White Female</em>’s pity</a></span> or <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/mar/22/heathers-mean-girls-hairspray\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/mar/22/heathers-mean-girls-hairspray\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Heathers</em>’</a></span> acid empathy in its demo.

You are driving little robot vehicles around the surface of Mars, doing jobs for people, and those jobs involve you having to build your own cars (or whatever else!) <!-- -->in a way that gets the job done.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Let’s say you get a contract where you need to take a steel beam from one little Martian base to another. You open up a lovely little building screen—one that is <em>very </em>reminiscent of LEGO instruction manuals—and, from a limited selection of parts, get building. You’ll need something to hold the steel, that ideally can also carry it across the surface of Mars, and you’ll also need something to reposition the steel when you get there for delivery.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">So you do that—or at least something you <em>think </em>will do that—and get driving. And within 20 seconds, you know you have messed <!-- -->it up. This little car isn’t going to be hauling anything anywhere, it’s a disaster, your wheels are spinning all over the place, the steel has fallen out and not for the first time in this game you will be back to, and spending a lot of time at, the drawing board. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Mars First Logistics</em> is, at its heart, a physics puzzler. If you’ve ever blown up a rocket on the launchpad in <em>Kerbal Space Program</em> or driven a misshapen buggy off a cliff in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, you’ll be right at home here. It’s not the challenge itself you’re really out to master, but the way that challenge is represented in a world that has a ruthless awareness of its own gravity:</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">All that jiggling around and broken cars and repeated failures could have been a recipe for frustration, but as the video above shows, <em>Mars First Logistics</em> is anything but. Thanks to a combination of its floaty gravity, cheery visuals and—I cannot quantify this, so just trust me—<em>cute </em>handling, to play it for stretches of time is to be at the helm of an adorable little blooper reel, each stuck payload or spinning set of tyres eliciting more of a “haha, we’ll get ‘em next time” than a “fuck this, I hate it”. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Please note I don’t want to somehow demean or dismiss<em> Mars First Logistics’</em> puzzling credentials by focusing solely on the fact it’s funny (even though, compared to gaming’s own deeply unfunny norms, this is a comedic masterpiece). It’s funny <em>because </em>it’s so hard, and that humour does a fantastic job of defusing the trial-and-error that could so easily have frustrated in a game like this. Even <em>Tears of the Kingdom’s</em> toughest nuts are child’s play compared to some of the challenges here, which don’t just ask a lot of you in terms of carrying them out—delicately balancing an ever-toppling payload as you drive it over bumpy hills—but in preparing for them in the first place.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">See, <em>Mars First Logistics</em> isn’t an immediately open sandbox game, it makes you earn it. You don’t start it with every tool at your fingertips, each part available in limitless quantities. You get money for completing courier jobs, and you can then spend that money unlocking more parts. So there’s an economy at play, allowing you to focus on the type of vehicles you want to build, and how fancy you want to make them. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"0a64169dbc425c4ad3b8e07f280cf080\" data-recommend-id=\"image://0a64169dbc425c4ad3b8e07f280cf080\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"0a64169dbc425c4ad3b8e07f280cf080\" data-recommend-id=\"image://0a64169dbc425c4ad3b8e07f280cf080\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I found myself spending most of my time not on the game’s open world but in its LEGO-like building screen, endlessly tinkering with wheels and control arms and servos  that can be arrayed however you like them, or at least however you think they’ll be able to get a job done.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s fun to mess around with, and can allow for creations of immense precision, but I think the real joy of <em>Mars First Logistics</em> is that it doesn’t need you to be perfect. You can shoot for it, sure, but at the end of the day you’re here to do a job, and so long as you get it done, the game is happy.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Take the steel beam job I mentioned above. I <em>could </em>have spent an age agonising over the most economical and functional vehicle possible, which is something the game definitely allows for and a path which some players might feel compelled to force themselves down. What I ended up doing after a few hilariously inept failures, though, was creating a buggy that could just drag the beam precariously across the countryside, which worked so long as I drove <em>really </em>carefully.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">A good video game would have forced me to make the economical and functional one. A very good one would let me make whatever the hell I want. A great video game lets me do whatever I want <em>and </em>makes it funny while I’m screwing it up.</p>', '2024-01-10 16:47:01', '2024-01-10 16:47:01', 'Mars First Logistics Is A Deeply Funny Video Game', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/15140d9a55dc10812c5952e1a9f91d40.jpg', 'pc', 'https://kotaku.com/mars-first-logistics-steam-review-impressions-pc-funny-1850575480', 'Mars First Logistics, released last week into Early Access on Steam, is a game w...', ''),

Instead, we need to fire up their own desktop app first and <em>then </em>start our games.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">There are many reasons for this.

On arrival, you meet your furious cousin Tabitha with whom you’re staying, and then a group of other local 20-somethings whom you befriend.

Maybe you’re preternaturally attractive, or perhaps incredibly book smart. You could get yourself the extra perception of a keen eye, or...the ability to talk to animals. Each dramatically affects how you experience the story to come. And from the start, you begin deciding how you want to interact at any given moment, allowing you to be told its creepy tale of woodland horrors and impending doom defined by the relationships you form, the places you visit, and the people you betray.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I’ve played so many games over the years that have promised the above, and so very few have delivered. But <em>Scarlet Hollow</em> is an exemplar, a game that truly understands that the trick is not to try to write an infinite number of story paths but rather to allow the player to experience its core story path in a unique way. And Chapter 4 goes <em>so</em> much further with this, not only carrying over all your decisions and relationships from the previous three episodes but based on those, allowing you to make enormously important decisions about how things will progress.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"bba05d8eb06134de770355b1d87d7c5c\" data-recommend-id=\"image://bba05d8eb06134de770355b1d87d7c5c\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2510\" data-height=\"1413\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Having your tea leaves read.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"bba05d8eb06134de770355b1d87d7c5c\" data-recommend-id=\"image://bba05d8eb06134de770355b1d87d7c5c\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2510\" data-height=\"1413\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Having your tea leaves read.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You’ll note I’m being deliberately ambiguous here because reviewing a game halfway through its planned seven chapters is not an easy task. Literally everything is a spoiler at this point, not only in the sense of opening a book midway through and starting to read, but even acknowledging the characters who are still around. People have lived and died based on my actions.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Instead, I’ll talk more broadly. In this latest and largest chapter, with many friendships formed or lost, and the core elements of the story already laid out, it’s able to let stuff really get rolling. Chapter 4 is where the game leans much harder into its horror, yet is the first time you’ll be able to engage in any of the five possible romance options. Which is a pleasing contrast.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">While you’ve only been in town for four days, a <em>lot</em> has happened to you and your group of friends. An <em>awful</em> lot if you made one particular, game-changing decision at the end of Chapter 3. So being able to tell the character of your choice that you’re into them doesn’t feel rushed or forced—and indeed, you’re perfectly welcome not to say any such thing to anyone. The horror, meanwhile, is also surprisingly variable, given how you choose to approach things.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"> I’m loath to deliberately see multiple paths, preferring to just play through for the sake of preserving my own experience, but for the sake of reviewing, I obviously had to check out if other options really were as divergent as they appeared, or if they were bluffs that would steer back to the same course. They weren’t bluffs. One side path I took with a safe save beforehand saw the most incredibly grisly events take place, and I can’t even imagine where the story would go following them. Replaying the whole chapter, but changing how I ended Chapter 3, saw even more changes. It’s ultimately the same game, the same scenes in a similar order, but it’s how you perceive them that so dramatically alters. </p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"dce707e20e24b93e40f03e21449bb3df\" data-recommend-id=\"image://dce707e20e24b93e40f03e21449bb3df\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2506\" data-height=\"1413\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The local police aren\'t exactly helpful.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"dce707e20e24b93e40f03e21449bb3df\" data-recommend-id=\"image://dce707e20e24b93e40f03e21449bb3df\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2506\" data-height=\"1413\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The local police aren\'t exactly helpful.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">For a game that’s played by making narrative choices, Chapter 4 achieves something incredible: a sense of urgent, panicked danger. Despite being able to click through the dialogues at my own pace, I found myself frantically speeding up at points, chased as I was, desperately looking for a route to safety! In other places, depending on how you ended the previous chapter, the game limits your choices, reversing this feeling and making me wish I could somehow slow things down to not miss out on any element.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I’m so obsessed with how intricately <em>Scarlet Hollow</em> crafts its narrative that I could forget to talk about its art. But this continues to be stunning, every scene hand-drawn, and while it doesn’t boast the remarkable animated dream art of Chapter 3, it’s far more detailed, displaying stunning drawings for scenes barely glimpsed at once as you play. That the small team behind this project is able to get more ambitious with every chapter is incredible.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I feel like <em>Scarlet Hollow</em> is a demonstration of how the format for the visual novel is just a foundation on which so much greater can be built. While the screenshots may look like a standard VN, the game itself is vastly more, not just with its RPG-like systems and ridiculously complex balancing of choices, but the far greater sense of scale, time, and significance. I’ve been blown away by it all over again.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You can get <em>Scarlet Hollow</em>’s first four chapters <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1609230/Scarlet_Hollow/\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1609230/Scarlet_Hollow/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">from Steam right now</a></span>.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">  <em>This article originally appeared on </em><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://buried-treasure.org/2022/12/scarlet-hollow-episode-4/\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://buried-treasure.org/2022/12/scarlet-hollow-episode-4/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buried Treasure</a></span>. <em>You can </em><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.patreon.com/buriedtreasure\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.patreon.com/buriedtreasure\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>support the Patreon here</em></a></span><em>.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"> <br></p>', '2024-01-10 16:47:01', '2024-01-10 16:47:01', 'The Best Narrative Game Of The Last Two Years Just Got Even Better', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/24dc462032cc311d27017dc7c7140d24.jpg', 'pc', 'https://kotaku.com/steam-pc-visual-novel-scarlet-hollow-black-tabby-games-1849868619', 'I am so beyond delighted to report that Scarlet Hollow, one of my favorite games...', ''),

This is a <em>Hexen-</em>like<!-- --> FPS, with enormous, sprawling maps, a whole bunch of <!-- --> weapons, an array of enemy types, and some fresh ideas original to the genre.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In three chapters, like all such games should be, the game’s 21 maps are spread between these via three hubs. Each hub has a collection of portals, unlocked by completing tasks in one or another, and dashing between them all as you find keys, new abilities, and so on. It gives it a little flavour of <em>Metroid</em> in amongst the fast-paced frenetic combat and exploration.</p>\n\n\n<section class=\"sc-q35npn-0 eNnFZk\">\n</section>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">What I really love here is that <em>Hands Of Necromancy</em> doesn’t feel beholden to <em>Heretic</em> and <em>Hexen</em>, but rather inspired by them to then be its own thing. So as you would hope, there’s a mix of ranged and close-up combat, with a sword and fireball in your starting line-up, then ever-expanded upon as you progress. You find a whirlwind spell that lets you unleash mini tornados, that swoosh enemies backward, and if pinned against a wall, really takes the life out of them. There’s a freezy ice wand, a scythe of rather impressive power, and even a gun when you get far enough in.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Enemies are an amazing mix, with creepy-crawlies, floaty magic-wielding wizards, flying bats (that <em>aren’t</em> impossibly annoying!), and stomping golems. By chapter 2 this same gang is joined by all manner of even more deadly beasties, until fights can be a crazed barrage of colour and gore.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"6654205653c413fef22ad19488b082b4\" data-recommend-id=\"image://6654205653c413fef22ad19488b082b4\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2556\" data-height=\"1406\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"An array of enemies all attacking at once in Hands Of Necromancy.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"6654205653c413fef22ad19488b082b4\" data-recommend-id=\"image://6654205653c413fef22ad19488b082b4\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2556\" data-height=\"1406\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"An array of enemies all attacking at once in Hands Of Necromancy.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s all in 2.5D, but with some very pretty lighting, the whole thing built in GZDoom. The pixel art on the creature designs is fantastic, and while the game leans too much toward gloomy environs, the locations feel detailed and interesting to explore. And more importantly, level design is top-notch, focused on large locations to explore, packed with underground chambers, maze-like crypts, and puzzle-filled towns.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Your character, himself an evil sorcerer, is no hero, out here looking to expand his range of abilities, and fighting not to survive, but because you just want to fight. This obviously doesn’t hugely impact the experience, until you’re reminded of it when picking up a powerful weapon and letting out a villainous cackle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Oh, and as you progress you gain the ability to turn into various enemy types, including the little snake, the punchy golem, and a horned devil-like beast. This can be used for puzzle solving and secret finding, but also just to fight in a different way. I don’t think I’ve ever seen an FPS give the character the ability to transform into the enemies, and it’s such a splendid idea.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"d44f856864158a3fd3f70d84d6d502bd\" data-recommend-id=\"image://d44f856864158a3fd3f70d84d6d502bd\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2420\" data-height=\"1368\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A crescent moon rises over a town in Hands Of Necromancy, as my golem fist punches.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"d44f856864158a3fd3f70d84d6d502bd\" data-recommend-id=\"image://d44f856864158a3fd3f70d84d6d502bd\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2420\" data-height=\"1368\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A crescent moon rises over a town in Hands Of Necromancy, as my golem fist punches.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The game estimates a 7-hour play-time, which is completely bonkers.

I guess you could blitz through it much more quickly, but that would seem such a waste.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This is tremendous stuff, a game that could absolutely have been released alongside Raven Software’s mid-90s fantas<!-- -->y shooters and held up.

Ultimately, it makes slogging through <em>The Teal Mask</em>’s paltry offerings worth the effort.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>The Indigo Disk </em>picks up with new characters Kieran and Carmine returning to their Unova-based school, Blueberry Academy. The school invites you to be an exchange student, and Blueberry Academy is a Pokémon trainer’s dream facility, as it’s built around a terarium that emulates four different biomes. Students capture and study Pokémon in habitats analogous to their natural homes. It’s a decent enough framing for a reasonably sized open-world environment, while also bringing some familiar Pokémon back into the fray.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>Buy <em>The Hidden Treasure Of Area Zero:</em></strong><em> </em><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\"[]\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pok%C3%A9mon-Scarlet-Violet-Expansion-Pass/dp/B0BXN2HHF1/ref=sr_1_2?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-indigo-disk-dlc-review-terapagos-1851100679&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\" data-amazonasin=\"B0BXN2HHF1\" data-amazontag=\"kinjakotakulink-20\">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://howl.me/ckAmpU2byt3\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://howl.me/ckAmpU2byt3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fpokemon-scarlet-and-violet-expansion-pass-the-hidden-treasure-of-area-zero---nintendo-switch%2F391649.html\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fpokemon-scarlet-and-violet-expansion-pass-the-hidden-treasure-of-area-zero---nintendo-switch%2F391649.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\">GameStop</a></span></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"45cd97e3583217c67ffc63b6bf558e10\" data-recommend-id=\"image://45cd97e3583217c67ffc63b6bf558e10\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Shep walks into the terarium. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"45cd97e3583217c67ffc63b6bf558e10\" data-recommend-id=\"image://45cd97e3583217c67ffc63b6bf558e10\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Shep walks into the terarium. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h12\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>Back to school</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Blueberry Academy is practically a workshop for building teams, customizing your character, and rounding up Legendary Pokémon for competitive play. Every trainer showdown is a double battle based around a competitive strategy. Sure, you can over-level and beat most of them with a super-effective move, but <em>The Indigo Disk </em>takes a refreshingly larger view of what <em>Pokémon </em>battles can be, rather than the tutorial-level strategies you tend to find in the base game.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Even after finishing the main story, I’m having a lot of fun diving into Blueberry Academy’s extracurricular activities beyond catching and battling. The school has plenty of engaging systems and additional storylines to follow, such as inviting coaches from <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>’s Paldea region to visit me at the school, customizing my character with new haircuts and Poké Ball throwing styles, and tracking down Legendary Pokémon in <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-indigo-disk-blueberry-legendary-1851090227\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-indigo-disk-blueberry-legendary-1851090227\">the most absurd version of the endgame Legendary Feast</a></span> in the series yet.<br></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s a shame that getting to all those clever features and side stories is a bit of a hassle. Part of that is because navigating the terarium is just as broken and buggy as any other version of <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>. What’s more, <em>The Indigo Disk </em>implements Blueberry Quests that become the basis of everything you do in the DLC. While they do expand in complexity, these are pretty much the equivalent of a live-service game’s dailies, where you do menial tasks to earn microscopic amounts of in-game currency.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"587ce596860c8152d4631e63dd8f6961\" data-recommend-id=\"image://587ce596860c8152d4631e63dd8f6961\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\'Larry says \"Calling me all the way out to another region...

But it does mean I spent swaths of <em>The Indigo Disk </em>doing silly little chores like defeating 10 Pokémon with quick battles, traveling an arbitrary distance, or crafting a technical machine just to satisfy the app on my character’s phone to give me the school’s made-up money. (Note: all money is made up.) It feels like unnecessary padding rather than a rewarding grind. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Everything you do in Blueberry Academy, from the main quest to the character customization, is tied to doing banal tasks just to make your BP number go up. Every time I realize I don’t have enough BP, I run to the closest group of wild Pokémon and send my Raichu after them until the app beeps in my favor. Sure, it makes you engage with the world, but it’s never in a way that feels meaningful. <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>give you a lot of verbs to use in a shallow world, and this loop of grinding quests to get the smallest amount of BP is the most blatant it’s ever felt.<br></p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"0999e84e7311aee3a997e8268f39bbec\" data-recommend-id=\"image://0999e84e7311aee3a997e8268f39bbec\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Terapagos smiles at something off-screen.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"0999e84e7311aee3a997e8268f39bbec\" data-recommend-id=\"image://0999e84e7311aee3a997e8268f39bbec\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Terapagos smiles at something off-screen.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h13\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>From ambition to reality</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I can forgive the mindlessness of <em>The Indigo Disk</em>’s weird, grindy loop because there’s some really cool features hidden behind them, and the DLC does have a pretty great finale. It doesn’t come close to <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>’s mind-blowing Yoko Taro-ass ending, but it does wrap up some of the mysteries of the Paldea region with some flair and emotional weight. I was disappointed by <em>The Indigo Disk</em>’s centering of new characters instead of the base game’s cast, but, its use of key players like Kieran—who has turned into an unhinged, Joffrey <em>Game of Thrones</em>-like bully after the events of <em>The Teal Mask</em>—still hit.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I’m not thrilled <em>The Indigo Disk </em>doesn’t go especially deep into the lore that fans have been speculating over for the past year, such as how its mascot, the Legendary multi-colored turtle Terapagos, could have factored into the events of the original games’ ending. Still, it is at least nice to put a face to what makes the Paldea region special. In the end, you find out what the titular Hidden Treasure of Area Zero is, but there are still parts of Paldean lore that remain a mystery. Maybe it’s fine that fans can continue to theorycraft about some pillars of <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>’s story, but I would have liked to have seen a finale that went as hard as the main game.</p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Pokémon Scarlet And Violet: The Indigo Disk\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"pok-mon-scarlet-and-violet-the-indigo-disk\">\n\n</section></aside>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Now that I’ve seen credits and am still grinding through Blueberry Academy’s myriad attractions, I’m running into all the same issues I have been since <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>launched last year. It’s still buggy, it’s still ugly, it still has some very Game Freak quality-of-life issues I can’t believe got through to the final product. (Why do I have to pay for each Poké Ball throwing style to see what it looks like?)<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But I also see the flashes of <em>Pokémon</em>’s untapped potential that <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>have always showcased. The open world isn’t deep, but riding around it seamlessly with your friends is still a childhood dream made reality. The Terapagos storyline has some underwhelming conclusions, but it’s presented with a strong emotional core and is a reminder that there are always discoveries to be made in the <em>Pokémon </em>world.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"892ee2b597e0d9c5c2414b0d6e868e08\" data-recommend-id=\"image://892ee2b597e0d9c5c2414b0d6e868e08\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Shep stands at the Blueberry Academy entrance.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"892ee2b597e0d9c5c2414b0d6e868e08\" data-recommend-id=\"image://892ee2b597e0d9c5c2414b0d6e868e08\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Shep stands at the Blueberry Academy entrance.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">That said, I’m getting bored of looking at Game Freak’s RPGs and saying “wow, this team has some really ambitious ideas,” when I’d rather be able to say “this is a stellar <em>Pokémon </em>game.” <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus </em>is the closest we’ve gotten in over a decade. <em>The Indigo Disk </em>may have some great concepts, but ultimately, the game still feels like a concept that hasn’t been fully realized.

Wonder</em> doesn’t cure covid-19. Trust me on that. But, if you ignore that one flaw and focus on everything else—the gorgeous graphics, the immensely creative levels, the pitch-perfect music—it’s easy to see this is one of Nintendo’s best <em>Mario </em>games in years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>Check Out <em>Super Mario Bros.

Wonder</em>, out now on Switch, is the latest entry in Nintendo’s historic <em>Mario </em>franchise, and the first traditional 2D sidescroller starring everyone’s favorite plumber in over a decade. <em>Wonder </em>is also the first new <em>Mario </em>game to launch after the immensely popular animated film starring Chris Pratt and Jack Black. And let’s not forget, It’s also the first <em>Mario </em>game to feature a new voice actor as the famous Italian hero. All of that adds up to a weird, higher-than-normal amount of pressure and eyeballs on what was already a very hyped, highly anticipated <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> game. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Put in a similar situation, I’d suspect other studios and developers might play it extremely safe, creating something solid but familiar. Thankfully, history has shown us over and over that Nintendo isn’t like most other game companies, and <em>Wonder </em>is a testament to that.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">At first glance, you might assume <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> is just another 2D<em> Mario </em>platformer, starring the iconic character, all his friends, the evil Bowser, and a plethora of new levels to hop through while collecting coins. And yes, that’s still the basic formula at work here in <em>Wonder</em>. But Nintendo uses that simple and proven design as a foundation for something wacky and fresh.<br></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h82512\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Wild, wacky weeds</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This is most evident in the new Wonder Flowers, power-ups hidden in most levels that, when activated, trigger wild changes that alter how Mario looks, moves, or interacts with the world. These changes aren’t simple, either, like making Mario run a bit faster or making levels simply change color. Instead, Wonder Flowers dramatically and playfully throw out all the Mario rules and traditions veteran players might expect.<br></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Once you trigger a flower, pipes may start to slink around like snakes, the world might become filled with water, Mario might turn into a super tall monstrosity or the entire level might stop and prompt you to answer some trivia questions.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"f864e0f4f607beb14a05f6a1f1a83633\" data-recommend-id=\"image://f864e0f4f607beb14a05f6a1f1a83633\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot shows a silhouetted and very tall Mario jumping over a Goomba. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"f864e0f4f607beb14a05f6a1f1a83633\" data-recommend-id=\"image://f864e0f4f607beb14a05f6a1f1a83633\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot shows a silhouetted and very tall Mario jumping over a Goomba. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Some of my favorite effects completely changed how I played the game, with one flower altering the perspective of the stage, turning <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> into a top-down action game instead of a 2D platformer. Another time, a flower turned me into a Goomba—unable to jump or move fast—and filled the level with enemies who wanted to eat me. This meant I had to time out my moves and use mushrooms to hide and...oh wait a minute, would you look at that! I’m playing a stealth game starring Mario.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">None of these Wonder Flower experiences stick around too long, ending after a few minutes at most, and you can ignore the flower and complete the level normally if you so desire. But each time I started up a course in <em>Wonder</em>, I was excited to see the next creative twist on Mario. It reminded me of when I first played <em>Super Mario 64</em> as a kid and didn’t know much about the series or what to expect. Each new enemy and new world threw me for a loop. And <em>Wonder </em>recreates that feeling of well…wonder that has been missing in so many 2D <em>Mario </em>games for so long.</p>\n\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Super Mario Bros. Wonder\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"super-mario-bros-wonder\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s not just the Wonder Flowers that add to this sense of wonder, but Nintendo’s decision to stuff the game with mostly new enemies and power-ups. (Though some classics like the Fire Flower and Koopas do make a return, too.)<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I’d often encounter some odd new enemy, like a walking firework shooter, and have to take a moment to figure it out. And once I had grokked it, I’d run into a new power-up—like the famous Elephant Fruit—and would then learn a new way to interact with or use it. Other power-ups like the Drill Helmet and Bubble Flower change how you explore levels or take out enemies. The result is that<em> Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> feels endlessly fresh, and is one of the most creative video games I’ve played in a long time.<br></p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h82513\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>It’s fun, but is it hard?</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Of course, all this wacky Wonder Flower stuff isn’t enough to make a <em>Mario </em>game good. The other big factor is how it actually feels to play, and <em>Wonder </em>nails this aspect perfectly. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Running and jumping feel weighty, but not too heavy. Mario has a sense of momentum and heft, but he doesn’t feel like a lead weight holding the action back. Likewise, he doesn’t bounce around wildly like a bouncy ball covered in grease. I always felt like I had complete control of Mario, no matter how wild things got. So when I landed a cool move or pulled off a tricky jump, I felt like I did it. And when Mario died, it was always my fault and I knew what I did wrong and how to not screw it up next time.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Now, just how often you fail in<em> Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> is at the center of some online discourse. It seems like many folks are worried that Nintendo’s latest platformer isn’t a tough-as-nails experience. And the short answer is, yeah, it’s not very hard. If you’ve played past Mario games and platformers, odds are you’ll end <em>Wonder </em>with a surplus of extra lives and not too many deaths. Even I, someone who isn’t a platformer pro, ended <em>Wonder</em> with nearly 80 extra lives, and that’s without abusing any glitches or exploits. But I’m fine with this.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If you want a super hard <em>Mario </em>game, the internet has spent years making ROM hacks and <em>Mario Maker</em> levels that will give you all the Kaizo action you could ever want. I also think that some complaints about <em>Wonder</em> being “too easy” come from folks who have played hundreds or thousands of official <em>Mario </em>levels, fan hacks, and other monstrosities, and these people are just never going to be challenged by anything from modern-day Nintendo. And that’s okay. I prefer Nintendo make creative and silly Mario games for the other 95% of players out there who just want to enjoy some Mario platforming without hair-pulling pixel-perfect precision platforming. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In other words, if you want a harder <em>Mario </em>game, there are plenty of options. However, I also acknowledge that <em>Wonder </em>could probably ramp up difficulty a tad without losing less-experienced players, especially in the first few worlds and courses, as some of those are almost mind-numbingly easy.<br></p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"0edfa31f4762c23b91c2ca19cd2537d2\" data-recommend-id=\"image://0edfa31f4762c23b91c2ca19cd2537d2\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot shows Mario running away from enemies on pink roller blades. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"0edfa31f4762c23b91c2ca19cd2537d2\" data-recommend-id=\"image://0edfa31f4762c23b91c2ca19cd2537d2\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot shows Mario running away from enemies on pink roller blades. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In Nintendo’s defense, <em>Wonder </em>does seem to try and placate both experts and newcomers with its badge system. Once equipped, the different badges you unlock throughout the campaign can let Mario jump higher, move faster, collect coins from defeating enemies, or even shoot a grappling hook.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Some of the weirder badges in <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> can make the game trickier to complete, like one that makes Mario hop all the time. Other badges have the opposite effect, adding blocks into levels to make them easier or giving Mario a Super Mushroom at every checkpoint or level start. It’s a system, like the Wonder Flowers, that seems designed to shake up the <em>Mario </em>formula but can also be ignored by players who prefer a pure platforming experience.<br></p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h82514\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>The best medicine</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I guess, before I wrap this up, I should mention the game’s “story.” The creativity and freshness found in the rest of the game doesn’t extend to the story of <em>Wonder</em>, which features Bowser stealing some magical power and becoming a big threat, and Mario running through seven worlds to collect the needed resources to stop the famous villain. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s nothing too groundbreaking, though the final fight against Bowser is very good. But I don’t play Mario games for thrilling narratives or dramatic character arcs. I come back to these games because they—the best ones at least—make me smile, are endlessly inventive, and just feel good as heck to play.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"0d910539cf0574592efbf8969a753bb1\" data-recommend-id=\"image://0d910539cf0574592efbf8969a753bb1\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot shows Mario running on top of a moving pipe. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"0d910539cf0574592efbf8969a753bb1\" data-recommend-id=\"image://0d910539cf0574592efbf8969a753bb1\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot shows Mario running on top of a moving pipe. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I mentioned at the top that <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> didn’t cure my covid-19 infection, which is true, but I made that joke because if any video game could make someone feel physically better, this would be it.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Wonder</em> is a gorgeous, cartoonish jolt of creativity and silliness that makes me smile each time I play it. I genuinely felt better after a few hours of <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em>. It made me feel like a little kid again. Anything was possible in each of its courses, and by the end I had seen things I never expected to see in a Mario game. The feeling of playing <em>Wonder</em> didn’t cure my illness, but if I could bottle it and save it for a rainy day, I’d do it in a heartbeat. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Instead, I guess I’ll just play <em>Wonder</em> again the next time I need a pick-me-up. That’s easier and sounds like a lot more fun. <br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>Check Out <em>Super Mario Bros.

But divorced from most <em>Pokémon </em>games’ typical competitive sport framing, <em>Detective Pikachu Returns</em>, like the 3DS game and movie before it,<em> </em>provides a fascinating glimpse into the reality of the franchise’s strange world.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Ryme City, the metropolis where the <em>Detective Pikachu </em>series takes place, is what lets these games thrive in a mystery genre. Here, Pokémon live alongside humans as citizens rather than being kept in Poké Balls until they’re ready to battle. The city is both a tacit commentary on the competitive battling concept <em>Pokémon </em>was built on, and a perfect setting for an adventure game not beholden to turn-based conflict. The mysteries Tim Goodman and his talking, titular partner ‘mon solve in Ryme City are uniquely catered to the <em>Pokémon </em>universe without having to fall back on the same cultural touchstones as games like <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>, where problems are resolved through battle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>Buy <em>Detective Pikachu Returns:</em></strong><em> </em><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\"[]\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Detective-PikachuTM-Returns-Version-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0C8YBXXSQ/ref=sr_1_1?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/detective-pikachu-returns-pokemon-review-switch-1850915720&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\" data-amazonasin=\"B0C8YBXXSQ\" data-amazontag=\"kinjakotakulink-20\">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://howl.me/ckJCiHna8Pp\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://howl.me/ckJCiHna8Pp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fdetective-pikachu-returns---nintendo-switch%2F396429.html\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fdetective-pikachu-returns---nintendo-switch%2F396429.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\">GameStop</a></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h9\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>A distinctly Pokémon mystery</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Because <em>Detective Pikachu Returns </em>commits to being a mystery game set in the <em>Pokémon </em>world, most of its puzzle-solving is made almost trivial by having a decent grasp of franchise lore and rules. Got a wall of ice blocking your path? Maybe check in with the fire-type Pokémon you saw on your way up. Need to follow a scent to track down evidence? A dog-like Pokémon can probably help you out. <em>Detective Pikachu Returns </em>doesn’t quite managed to deliver a complex mystery, but as someone who is mentally astral projecting into that universe at all times, it was a delight when my established <em>Pokémon </em>knowledge paid off, even when solutions felt incredibly obvious.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"d22a668f6064b3e6f504d9ac1a2a080c\" data-recommend-id=\"image://d22a668f6064b3e6f504d9ac1a2a080c\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Detective Pikachu hides while listening in on a suspect.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"d22a668f6064b3e6f504d9ac1a2a080c\" data-recommend-id=\"image://d22a668f6064b3e6f504d9ac1a2a080c\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Detective Pikachu hides while listening in on a suspect.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Sure, being a poké-pro accounts for some of that easy breeziness, but other times <em>Detective Pikachu Returns </em>just feels like an adventure game meant for young children. That isn’t inherently a bad thing, but it does mean certain aspects of gameplay are so simplistic that I question why they’re even present. QTE-driven action setpieces make a return, but they almost exclusively have you mashing A until your wrist cramps. And the collaborative nature of Tim and Pikachu’s detective work means you’ve always got someone talking you through each mystery, so there’s not much difficult deduction going on.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">A lot of <em>Detective Pikachu Returns</em>’ mystery solving can feel pretty uneventful because most of the game is just talking to people. There’s not a lot of overt puzzle-solving or deduction, more just talking with Pikachu until you decide what Pokémon in the environment to point at a problem. The biggest gameplay addition here are case-specific companions that Pikachu can ride around an area to help solve mysteries. Growlithe can sniff around to track a scent, Luxray can see through walls, and Pangoro can use Strength to push boulders out of the way.

However, the story’s subject matter makes it one of the franchise’s darker entries, which feels markedly at odds with how kid-friendly it is as a video game.<br></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The <em>Detective Pikachu </em>subseries inherently questions everything we know to be good and righteous about the <em>Pokémon </em>world. After all, why would Ryme City—a place where Pokémon battles don’t happen and Pokémon don’t stay in Poké Balls—exist if everyone was on board with the franchise’s core battling conceit? But <em>Detective Pikachu Returns </em>takes things a step further by pretty overtly questioning the competence of law enforcement, and going as far as to outwardly criticize how the entire institution can become corrupt. It stops short of getting too radical, but <em>Detective Pikachu Returns </em>is surprisingly upfront with its depiction of how state-sanctioned power allows some of the most corrupt to ascend to power and keep it. All of this is explored in a distinct <em>Pokémon </em>framing and builds upon those themes in a way that makes Ryme City one of the most well-realized settings in the series.</p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h10\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>Improving upon the movie’s weaknesses</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Beyond its commentary on institutional systems, <em>Detective Pikachu Returns</em>’ family narrative is maybe a bit inelegant in its dialogue, but the broad emotional strokes absolutely had me in their clutches. Unlike the live-action film, 2016’s original 3DS <em>Detective Pikachu</em> didn’t resolve its core mystery, which tasked Tim to find his missing father Harry with Pikachu by his side. The game’s take is a bit different from the movie’s, but it still has the same weight, and is the latest <em>Pokémon </em>game to strike a strong balance between weighty themes and dark twists while still being palatable to younger audiences. It doesn’t quite reach the buck-wild finale levels of <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus </em>or <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>’s, but I’m happy to see The Pokémon Company really leaning into the possibilities of this world rather than shying away.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>Buy <em>Detective Pikachu Returns:</em></strong><em> </em><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\"[]\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Detective-PikachuTM-Returns-Version-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0C8YBXXSQ/ref=sr_1_1?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/detective-pikachu-returns-pokemon-review-switch-1850915720&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\" data-amazonasin=\"B0C8YBXXSQ\" data-amazontag=\"kinjakotakulink-20\">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://howl.me/ckJCiHna8Pp\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://howl.me/ckJCiHna8Pp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fdetective-pikachu-returns---nintendo-switch%2F396429.html\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fdetective-pikachu-returns---nintendo-switch%2F396429.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\">GameStop</a></span></p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Detective Pikachu Returns\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"detective-pikachu-returns\">\n\n</section></aside>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Detective Pikachu Returns</em>’ late-game story swings elevate it beyond its mechanical simplicity, even if the live-action movie pretty much spoiled most of them in 2019. Part of the reason those reveals are still super effective is because the game pulls off a lot of those storylines in a more compelling fashion than the movie. The worst part of the live-action movie is how it pivots into being a disaster film in its final act and the explanations for its reveals feel underbaked. Whether by looking at the movie’s failings and iterating on them or because this is just what the team at Creatures had in mind from the beginning, <em>Detective Pikachu Returns</em>’ take on similar plot threads is just line-by-line better than the version we saw in theaters.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I say this as a person who loves the live-action movie. It’s one of my favorite things <em>Pokémon </em>has ever put out, even with its flimsy climax. Because that conclusion has been such a weird asterisk next to my recommendations of the film, seeing <em>Detective Pikachu Returns</em> handle so many of the reveals with greater clarity in the writing, motivation, and world-building was almost healing. There’s a specific case near the end of the game entirely about why Pikachu can talk to Tim when other critters can’t, and the writing around it was so clever compared to the movie’s spin on the same storyline that my appreciation for the game skyrocketed in its home stretch.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"8329296eddf53ccecb80f46b334d194a\" data-recommend-id=\"image://8329296eddf53ccecb80f46b334d194a\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Detective Pikachu sits with Tim in front of a fire.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"8329296eddf53ccecb80f46b334d194a\" data-recommend-id=\"image://8329296eddf53ccecb80f46b334d194a\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Detective Pikachu sits with Tim in front of a fire.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Somehow, the worst part of the <em>Detective Pikachu </em>movie is the best part of <em>Detective Pikachu Returns</em>. It feels like the conclusion I’ve been waiting for, even if getting there means going through a pretty unremarkable adventure game. But that was largely how I felt about the original 3DS <em>Detective Pikachu</em>. It was an incredibly simple mystery game meant to appeal to all ages, but in between the trivial puzzles and deduction, it delivered one of the best-ever depictions of the <em>Pokémon </em>world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Detective Pikachu Returns </em>isn’t setting up a sequel, and while I’m glad to have some closure, I am sad to leave Ryme City. Sometimes I get tired of sending Pokémon out for battle to knock each other out, and I just want to go on adventures with Pikachu by my side. <em>Detective Pikachu Returns </em>is imperfect, but lets me revisit the <em>Pokémon </em>world I’d most like to live in. I hope, even if this is the end of Tim and Pikachu’s story, it’s not the end of The Pokémon Company doing interesting, off-the-wall adventure games that can look at this universe in fresh ways. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>Buy <em>Detective Pikachu Returns:</em></strong><em> </em><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\"[]\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Detective-PikachuTM-Returns-Version-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0C8YBXXSQ/ref=sr_1_1?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/detective-pikachu-returns-pokemon-review-switch-1850915720&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\" data-amazonasin=\"B0C8YBXXSQ\" data-amazontag=\"kinjakotakulink-20\">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://howl.me/ckJCiHna8Pp\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://howl.me/ckJCiHna8Pp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fdetective-pikachu-returns---nintendo-switch%2F396429.html\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fdetective-pikachu-returns---nintendo-switch%2F396429.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\">GameStop</a></span></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">. </p>', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', 'Detective Pikachu Returns: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/0f434c18a804b2501cff6925b387ffa3.jpg', 'switch', 'https://kotaku.com/detective-pikachu-returns-pokemon-review-switch-1850915720', 'Detective Pikachu Returns, the new Switch adventure from Nintendo, is not great ...', '');

Either that, or their first DLC, <em>The Teal Mask</em>, is somehow worse at holding itself together than the base games were.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">At a glance, I’m not sure why walking through Kitakami, the DLC’s tiny new region, threatened to break the game, but I experienced some of the worst framerate dips (sometimes even complete stoppage) I’ve ever experienced on Nintendo’s hybrid handheld. <em>The Teal Mask </em>runs so poorly that it leaves me once again bewildered that the original games launched in the state they did. Perhaps unsurprisingly, <em>The Teal Mask </em>feels like a microcosm of the base games’ larger issues, as well as their strengths.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Coming off <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>’s Yoko Taro-ass finale and going into <em>The Teal Mask</em>’s relatively low-stakes <em>Pokémon </em>story feels like a nice palate cleanser. We’re not dealing with life-and-death right now, with the DLC instead bringing things back to your character’s school life. You get dragged into an exchange program (all by yourself, too, so don’t expect to see Nemona, Penny, or Arven) with students from Blueberry Academy, a sister school to your Naranja Academy/Uva Academy (game version depending). You’re all to meet at the remote region of Kitakami and learn about the local culture and legends and partake in a festival to celebrate some of the Pokémon folklore. The story is where <em>The Teal Mask </em>shines in spite of the technical troubles, so perhaps fittingly, this DLC embodies both the best and worst parts of <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>Buy <em>The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero:</em></strong><em> </em><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\"[]\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pok%C3%A9mon-Scarlet-Violet-Expansion-Pass/dp/B0BXN2HHF1/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-teal-mask-dlc-review-ogerpon-1850839564&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\" data-amazonasin=\"B0BXN2HHF1\" data-amazontag=\"kinjakotakulink-20\">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://howl.me/ckAmpU2byt3\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://howl.me/ckAmpU2byt3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\">Best Buy</a></span> |<span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fpokemon-scarlet-and-violet-expansion-pass-the-hidden-treasure-of-area-zero---nintendo-switch%2F391649.html\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fpokemon-scarlet-and-violet-expansion-pass-the-hidden-treasure-of-area-zero---nintendo-switch%2F391649.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\">GameStop</a></span></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"ac2ef5465b9ce1f02712ea1aebc0dea6\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ac2ef5465b9ce1f02712ea1aebc0dea6\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Kieran is shown holding a Pokeball in his hand before a battle.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"ac2ef5465b9ce1f02712ea1aebc0dea6\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ac2ef5465b9ce1f02712ea1aebc0dea6\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Kieran is shown holding a Pokeball in his hand before a battle.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>The Teal Mask</em> is at its best in its writing. New characters like the brother and sister duo Kieran and Carmine stand tall next to <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>’s already wonderful cast. Carmine is a hoot and a holler as she gives angry big sister energy and gradually softens overtime. Kieran, meanwhile, is the new expansion’s emotional core. Much of the DLC is about how kind-hearted people are excluded, and that extends both to the grander lore of Kitakami and its individual villages.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I’m really loving how much <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>delves into these really poignant stories, and even if <em>Teal Mask</em> never reaches the dramatic heights of the base games’ final hours, it feels reassuring to see Game Freak still writing <em>Pokémon </em>stories that build the world and its people out rather than feeling like vehicles to deliver more competitive tweaks and catchable critters. In that, <em>The Teal Mask </em>is already making a solid first impression for the wider expanded story the studio is adding through this collective <em>Hidden Treasure of Area Zero </em>expansion, which will be concluding in <em>The Indigo Disk</em> DLC set to launch later this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Those themes extend to the story of Ogerpon, the enigmatic legendary Pokémon who is the headliner of the DLC and owner of the titular mask. The grass-type, mask-wearing little guy is part of local urban legends that, as you play through <em>The Teal Mask</em>, reveal themselves to be half-truths, and circle back into the story of disenfranchisement the DLC illustrates with Kieran. The tale is compelling, and even if it doesn’t dig too deep, its take on the cognitive dissonance the locals feel toward tradition in the face of new information is a pretty cool use of <em>Pokémon </em>lore. I’m not super compelled by Ogerpon as a Pokémon, and its original mechanic of being able to swap typings and other properties by wearing different masks doesn’t feel super novel after the <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em> base games introduced modular typings with the Terastalize mechanic. Nonetheless, its story makes for an interesting cultural touchstone that helps fill out this new region.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"03e18ff42dcfd228f607d021ef7f43d4\" data-recommend-id=\"image://03e18ff42dcfd228f607d021ef7f43d4\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Ogerpon is shown standing at the end of a flight of stairs.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"03e18ff42dcfd228f607d021ef7f43d4\" data-recommend-id=\"image://03e18ff42dcfd228f607d021ef7f43d4\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Ogerpon is shown standing at the end of a flight of stairs.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>The Teal Mask</em>’s low stakes feel like tablesetting for <em>The Indigo Disk</em>, which appears to be delving further into the hanging threads left by <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>. Even so, <em>Teal Mask</em> harbors darker undercurrents that leave me more looking forward to that DLC we don’t yet have. But <em>Teal Mask</em> and <em>Indigo Disk</em> have been marketed as a two-parter, so that’s not terribly surprising, and I did find a lot to love in the ground-level conflicts and relationships in this opening chapter. The final scene of the DLC, which I won’t spoil here, did at least hint that these smaller stories may soon escalate into something larger, and given how well <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>’s writing has handled stories of trauma, especially that felt by children, I’m really eager to see how Game Freak concludes this story in the next download.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But goddamn, getting to it is so rough. Walking through Kitakami’s open world is an absolute slog, with me and my Raichu trying to walk through pretty barren environments peppered with only a few civilians. I’m not sure why <em>The Teal Mask </em>gave me even worse performance issues than the main game, but whatever the reason, its framerate drops are even worse than <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>’s. The wild thing is, I know this is how <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em> were. I’m keenly aware that despite my love of those games’ final hours, this was what I experienced for 25-30 hours as I made my way through Paldea to get to Area Zero.

(Don’t worry who you pick, they all play the same.) After selecting one of the classic Disney characters, what follows is a platforming adventure through a large, maze-like map spreading across multiple biomes that are filled with secrets, collectibles, and yes, Hidden Mickeys.<br></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h35\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>No fighting, but lots of jumping!</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">As the name implies, <em>Disney Illusion Island</em> is inspired by some of the most beloved old Mickey games, many of which had the word illusion in their titles. But unlike those games, which were traditional platformers with combat elements, <em>Illusion Island</em> ditches combat entirely and instead focuses on incredibly tight and fluid platforming. You won’t be jumping on top of enemies or picking up power-ups to shoot balls of fire or goo at baddies. While this might sound like an odd choice for a game that is Metroidvania-like in every other sense, it works wonderfully in <em>Illusion Island.</em><br></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">A big reason why the lack of combat never bothered me during my playthrough was because <em>Disney Illusion Island</em> never got dull. Every forty or so minutes I got a new ability that let me explore more of the map, or I took on some big platforming challenge or squared off against boss enemies—which don’t feature fighting, but instead rely on puzzles. One boss had me swing around specific points using my grapple ability. Eventually, after I dodged all the threats and activated every swing point, the enemy was knocked down and Mickey was able to use magic to turn them into stone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Disney Illusion Island </em>almost seems worried that you’ll get bored with it and stop playing, so it’s constantly trying to keep your attention, either through powers, collectibles, jokes, or silly characters. This mix of variety and approachability seems perfect for kids and adults alike.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Thankfully, the in-game map makes all of this content manageable. It’s easy to use and loads fast, letting you quickly see where you are and where you need to go. It also shows all the things you haven’t collected or paths you still need to unlock. Without this map,<em> Illusion Island</em> might feel like a chore to play. With it, the game is very hard to put down. I’d check it and think, “Well, I just need to go over there and I’ll get some more collectibles to unlock a health upgrade” and suddenly another 30 minutes had passed and I had not stopped playing. (This happened to me at least a few times.)<br></p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h36\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>A platformer for everyone (who owns a Switch)</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">What will also help kids (and adults with limited schedules) enjoy <em>Disney Illusion Island</em> is the way it gradually becomes more difficult, but never gets too hard. As long as I took my time or didn’t get distracted by the gorgeous art, I could avoid most baddies and traps. And when I did die, I never felt like the game had screwed me over thanks to its wonderfully snappy, responsive platforming controls and rock-solid performance when docked or played in handheld mode. Plus, deaths won’t cost you or your co-op partners much progress thanks to an ample amount of checkpoints throughout the world.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If you crave platformers that aren’t brutal nightmares bent on making you throw your controller in frustration, you should play <em>Illusion Island</em>. And for those who do want a bit more challenge, you can tweak how much damage Mickey and friends can take before dying. If you lower this amount, you’ll add a bit more spice to Disney’s latest game.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"56803eaabcb781bd311c4b3cc235d469\" data-recommend-id=\"image://56803eaabcb781bd311c4b3cc235d469\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot shows Minnie running across a platform near spikes. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"56803eaabcb781bd311c4b3cc235d469\" data-recommend-id=\"image://56803eaabcb781bd311c4b3cc235d469\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot shows Minnie running across a platform near spikes. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">My only major complaint with <em>Disney Illusion Island</em> is its Nintendo Switch exclusivity.

He’s an amnesiac who’s made a deal with a death god named Shinigami who takes the form of a purple puffball ghost with a love of carnage and death, all while basking in it with lighthearted whimsy. Much like Kodaka’s previous work, the game uses the two characters’ contrasting views of the world to constantly oscillate between dire stakes and absurdist humor but uses its supernatural framing to crank the team’s usual antics up to an inevitable over-the-top conclusion. Much of <em>Rain Code </em>feels like Kodaka’s writing style at his most unhinged, no longer bound by the limitations of a (relatively) grounded setting and free to use magic, superpowers, and god-like entities to justify some wild imagery, for better or worse.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">For the first few chapters, I was put off by <em>Rain Code</em>’s supernatural elements and how they framed the mystery-solving. As Yuma and Shinigami stumble into solving crimes around the city of Kanai Ward, Shinigami opens up a pocket dimension to a Mystery Labyrinth. These are pretty comparable to a Palace in <em>Persona 5</em> in that they are physical manifestations of the mystery itself. Every question there is about a case is given a literal form, whether that be doors to walk through to answer a multiple-choice question or an enemy that Yuma must fight with a truth-bearing blade to literally <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/danganronpa-captures-the-feeling-of-real-life-arguments-1821589146\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/danganronpa-captures-the-feeling-of-real-life-arguments-1821589146\">cut through their arguments</a></span> as they appear in text on the screen. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Danganronpa </em>represented these same concepts through mini-games that were more symbolic, such as imagining yourself snowboarding down a slope and choosing paths representing answers as you made deductions. <em>Rain Code </em>uses the Mystery Labyrinth to give everything a diegetic place in its world. I admire the commitment to the bit, but the framing initially felt like it was the game bending over backward to bring <em>Danganronpa</em> mechanics into a legally distinct format in a way that justified every moment of deduction and reasoning in a tangible way, rather than a conceptual one.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It wasn’t until later chapters where <em>Rain Code </em>started to really reckon with the reality of using the Mystery Labyrinth that I started to buy in. Shinigami is a ghost when she and Yuma are in the real world, but once they enter the Labyrinth, she sheds her mascot character design for her true form: which is a tall, gothic woman who reaps upon the souls of the culprit at the end of each case. Once Yuma is confronted with the truth, he is also confronted with the cost of finding it. Unlike <em>Danganronpa</em>, this method and outcome aren’t forced on Yuma, he just continually falls on it as he’s put on his back foot. At its core, <em>Rain Code </em>is about the pursuit of the truth and its consequences, but while Shinigami leaves bodies in her wake, the game posits that the truth isn’t meant to be morally right or wrong. In exposing it, people can build from the truth rather than tear themselves down further.</p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Master Detective Archives: Rain Code\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"master-detective-archives-rain-code\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This is why <em>Rain Code </em>constantly invites comparisons to Kodaka’s most prolific work. If it weren’t for all the clear mechanical and artistic parallels, that baseline belief in people is the symmetry that connects this team’s past and present work. <em>Rain Code</em>’s latter chapters invoke the same outburst of emotions that this team is best known for, even if it takes its time getting there. In many ways, its narrative and mysteries get messy, sometimes diluted by the supernatural framing rather than enhanced by it. But despite my initial misgivings, I was surprised at how well it came together. Given this team’s history, I probably should’ve trusted <em>Rain Code</em> to get me by the end.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">All the framing aside, <em>Rain Code</em> does feel rough around the edges from a technical standpoint. Rather than using the 2D sprite-based visual novel style of <em>Danganronpa</em>, pretty much everything in <em>Rain Code </em>is rendered in 3D, and this game chugs something fierce on Switch. Whether it’s during the exploration segments through Kanai Ward or the action-oriented setpieces within the Mystery Labyrinth, the game often feels like it’s struggling to hold itself together. While third-person, 3D setup gives <em>Rain Code </em>its own flavor and allows the game some pretty spectacular visual moments (the neon-soaked cyberpunk aesthetic of Kanai Ward looks great when it’s not in motion), there were stretches of time where it felt like the game needed another pass for technical polish.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"23aa2484b76b8e3b6544f66b43019674\" data-recommend-id=\"image://23aa2484b76b8e3b6544f66b43019674\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Yuma is seen striking through a false claim in the Mystery Labyrinth.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"23aa2484b76b8e3b6544f66b43019674\" data-recommend-id=\"image://23aa2484b76b8e3b6544f66b43019674\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Yuma is seen striking through a false claim in the Mystery Labyrinth.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">At a certain point, I think I became desensitized to the framerate drops and bought into the concept and was happy to dive into Mystery Labyrinth. Comparatively, <em>Rain Code</em>’s cases aren’t quite as elaborate as its predecessor’s, but they each had satisfying mysteries and an explosive human element at their core. Even when I would feel skeptical about a reveal, <em>Rain Code </em>would quickly point to a clue I’d long forgotten that tied things together. Some solutions might have felt farfetched, but within the world it established, these cases felt airtight and satisfying to solve, even when the conclusion was devastating to watch unfold.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Rain Code </em>is built by a team that knows how to make these kinds of games, and as a long-time fan of the themes Kodaka tends to write around, I was pretty moved by the end even though it nearly lost me in the beginning. If you’ve never been a fan of Kodaka’s mix of camp, heavyhanded themes, and theatrics, <em>Rain Code </em>will likely not grab you. But despite it feeling like <em>Danganronpa</em>’s distant cousin, it makes it clear this team doesn’t have to lean on Monokuma’s death game as a crutch and can build something new upon its bones instead. Hopefully, this means Kodaka can continue to let old things die on their own terms and make new things instead.</p>', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', 'Review: The Makers Of Danganronpa Are Back With Another Mystery Banger', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/fd55437c2389edbd3a093839ded4fd5e.jpg', 'switch', 'https://kotaku.com/master-detective-archives-switch-review-danganronpa-1850592843', 'I would rather not liken Master Detective Archives: Rain Code to the games its c...', '');

Dogs frolic, horses run free in the fields, merchants take goods from one place to another—the song of life carries on without my involvement. The weather, heedless of my struggles, is apt to make my life more difficult, making surfaces I wish to climb slick with rain or blasting me with bolts of lightning.

For decades, <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"http://tevisthompson.com/saving-zelda/\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"http://tevisthompson.com/saving-zelda/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Zelda</em>’s design had stagnated</a></span>, becoming a rigid, lifeless sequence of locks and keys. The tales the games told were full of magic, but the gameplay had little magic or wonder to offer. <em>Breath of the Wild </em>changed all that, giving us a vast Hyrule full of natural beauty and magical mystery. The revelation that <em>Breath of the Wild</em>’s follow-up would be a direct sequel, set in the same Hyrule and continuing the story of the same Link and the same Zelda, left me <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/zelda-tears-kingdom-totk-gameplay-fuse-weapon-car-meat-1850274230\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/zelda-tears-kingdom-totk-gameplay-fuse-weapon-car-meat-1850274230\">concerned that we might be back on the path to sameness</a></span>, that Nintendo might play it safe with sequels that just replicated that game’s design principles rather than finding new ways to build on the series’ potential. Instead, though, what we’ve gotten is another game of incredible inventiveness, one that encourages play in the truest sense, that reminds us, if we’ve forgotten, that the world is full of magic, after all.</p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h89030\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>Forming a link with Hyrule</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Though <em>Breath of the Wild</em>’s narrative saw an amnesia-ridden Link rediscovering memories of his own past that illuminated his connection with Princess Zelda, the real relationship at the game’s core was the one between Link and Hyrule itself. You’re constantly climbing rocks, and it always starts thunderstorming at the worst time. <em>Breath of the Wild </em>really brings its own terrain to the forefront, making you aware of the natural world around you in a way few games do.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">The result was a game where just being in the world was its own reward. I’d climb mountains not because I expected to find some valuable item at the top, but just because I wanted to see the view from up there. While so many games incentivize us to explore with the hope of finding some item that will make us better or faster or stronger (I’m currently scouring every nook and cranny of <em>Diablo IV </em>for Altars of Lilith and the incremental bonuses they bestow), this was real exploration, of the sort where I just wanted to see what’s around the next curve in the road for its own sake.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Now <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>returns us to the same Hyrule. How can exploring the same Hyrule, one so many of us became so familiar with in <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, remain compelling a second time around? Because the passage of time leaves its mark on all things, and this Hyrule is deeply marked by time. Specifically, an event called the Upheaval has left Hyrule greatly changed, bringing floating islands into view in the skies above, opening chasms to vast depths below, and generally leaving the landscape significantly altered.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">In many ways <em>The Legend of Zelda </em>has long been concerned with the passage of time—think of earlier subtitles like <em>A Link to the Past </em>and <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, or the way that <em>Breath of the Wild</em>’s Hyrule had <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://carolynpetit.tumblr.com/post/158836151500/breath-of-the-wild-and-the-magic-of-the-temple-of\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://carolynpetit.tumblr.com/post/158836151500/breath-of-the-wild-and-the-magic-of-the-temple-of\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">faded echoes of places</a></span> many of us have visited in earlier games in the series. But here in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, the way that its world is simultaneously so similar to and yet so different from that in the previous game means we see and feel the direct impact of what the Upheaval has wrought more keenly than we’ve felt the forces of change in Hyrule before. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">There’s Kakariko Village, still in some ways the peaceful little hamlet you remember but it’s got fallen ruins in the hills above it now. There’s the old Rito Stable, a place you might have once stopped to pick up your horse when heading into the cold northwestern region of Hebra, but it’s now home to a newspaper. For <em>Breath of the Wild </em>players at least, there’s a delicious tension between the familiar and the new at work here, not unlike returning to your childhood hometown after years away and being thrown off by all the ways it’s changed in your absence.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\"><em>Breath of the Wild</em>’s exciting feeling that discovery awaits you everywhere is not just renewed in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, but enhanced. The world now stretches far beyond the familiar surface, with places to discover both high in the sky and far underground, and a thrilling assortment of new ways to do so. Gone are Link’s powers from <em>BotW</em>—his ability to summon a bomb out of thin air, or manifest a pillar of ice. In their stead is a fresh array of powers. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Ascend is a remarkable and intuitive new ability that lets Link launch himself straight up through solid terrain and emerge above. Not only is it a useful and fun way to elevate yourself to otherwise hard-to-reach places, but it also underscores the feeling the game creates that this is one cohesive, connected world. Once, upon using Ascend while deep in Hyrule’s subterranean Depths, I emerged to find myself atop a mountain, the blue sky above me. Of course I know the game had done plenty of loading while Link swam straight up through all those layers of rock, but the effect was nonetheless one of making me <em>feel </em>like this was a real place, with the Depths actually resting hundreds of feet below the surface.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"e5bff8bf1d0f7456971117ae4defc941\" data-recommend-id=\"image://e5bff8bf1d0f7456971117ae4defc941\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A bear is seen in the woods, viewed through a scope in Tears of the Kingdom.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"e5bff8bf1d0f7456971117ae4defc941\" data-recommend-id=\"image://e5bff8bf1d0f7456971117ae4defc941\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A bear is seen in the woods, viewed through a scope in Tears of the Kingdom.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">There’s also Recall, an ability which lets you rewind time for a given object. Players much cleverer than me have found <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/tears-of-the-kingdom-totk-zelda-recall-best-use-1850565308\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/tears-of-the-kingdom-totk-zelda-recall-best-use-1850565308\">all kinds of uses for this one</a></span>, and I can’t wait to see <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/tears-of-the-kingdom-zelda-speedrun-record-first-twitch-1850432539\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/tears-of-the-kingdom-zelda-speedrun-record-first-twitch-1850432539\">how speedrunners use this</a></span> and Link’s other new powers to finish the game in no time flat. Fuse, meanwhile, lets you magically combine objects with your melee weapons, arrows, and shields, enabling you to create all manner of useful tools and plenty of goofy oddities, too. There’s a childlike delight in thinking the way this game encourages you to think, and then following through on those ideas. “What if I slap this fire fruit on my arrow and then shoot at the red barrels in that bokoblin camp?” Well, things blow up real good, that’s what, but the real fun of it all is that there are so many different ways to approach any such situation.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">And crucial to that freedom is perhaps the game’s most impactful new ability, Ultrahand, and the bevy of new Zonai devices—the creations of an ancient, once-lost culture reappearing in Hyrule after the Upheaval—that you can acquire. Ultrahand lets you take just about anything and grab it, manipulate it, and, most importantly, effectively glue it to other things. It’s very simple, and yet opens up a staggering number of possibilities when you consider that among the devices you can acquire are gliders, fans, energy beams, balloons, wheels, cannons, springs, and more. There’s a tactile pleasure to the assembly process, too, a hands-on, arts-and-crafts feel to manipulating the objects in three-dimensional space and affixing them together.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Many inventive players have fashioned all kinds of <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/tears-of-the-kingdom-how-make-air-bike-map-underground-1850481187\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/tears-of-the-kingdom-how-make-air-bike-map-underground-1850481187\">useful vehicles</a></span> and <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/zelda-totk-tears-of-the-kingdom-fuse-weapons-break-1850446937\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/zelda-totk-tears-of-the-kingdom-fuse-weapons-break-1850446937\">powerful war machines</a></span> capable of defeating even the most powerful beasts you might encounter in Hyrule. Me, I’m more basic. I feel pretty good about myself if I just manage to <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/zelda-tears-kingdom-totk-link-ultrahand-logs-crafting-1850437422\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/zelda-tears-kingdom-totk-link-ultrahand-logs-crafting-1850437422\">glue a few logs together</a></span> and position my makeshift creation just right so that I can climb to an area I wouldn’t otherwise be able to reach. But this, too, is a strength of the game. It rewards those who harness the full potential of those Zonai devices in their own remarkable creations, but it also allows you to approach any challenge in any number of ways. Games routinely tout the idea of “player freedom” but they often effectively mean, “You can kill these people by sneaking up on them or you can kill them by fighting them in the open.” In <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, however, you truly feel free to solve the challenges it puts before you in countless ways.</p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h89031\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>Link and Zelda, wounded heroes</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Heroes often pay a price. Luke loses a hand. Frodo a finger. Early in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, Link and Zelda have an encounter that costs Link an arm, and Zelda—well, I’m not telling, but she pays a price too. Link is promptly furnished with a new arm, but still, the loss feels potent, a promising start to a legend that may go on to actually grapple with the things legends grapple with. Life and death. Sacrifice. Grief. Those kinds of things.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">And for a while, it seems that melancholy undercurrent may lend the story being told here some emotional or thematic weight. Scattered across this post-Upheaval Hyrule are massive geoglyphs, images that each hold in them a memory which sheds some light on where Zelda has gone. They’re a stunning new feature of the landscape, one you can glimpse even from a great distance, and it’s wonderfully rewarding to spot one far away, make your way there, and then inspect it closely for where the memory is actually located. Piecing together the mystery of Zelda’s disappearance is exciting, too, as it deepens the feeling of Hyrule as an ancient place, one with real history, where the past remains alive in the present.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">However, like <em>Breath of the Wild</em> in which, narratively, Zelda single-handedly keeps Calamity Ganon at bay for 100 years while Link recovers his power, this tale largely sidelines the princess even while giving her something crucial to do. These stories seem written to fend off criticism about Zelda being “damseled,” giving defenders the ammunition to declare that, in them, she does incredibly heroic things, while still effectively damseling her by setting up a dynamic in which you, as Link, must find her, save her, undo the circumstance that has cost her so much. Perhaps one day we’ll get a <em>Zelda </em>game that actually acknowledges Zelda’s heroism in its structure and gameplay as well as its narrative rather than one that wants to have its cake and eat it too, making her “heroic” but marginalizing her at the same time.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Ganon, too, is a disappointment here. Link’s old archnemesis, the recurring embodiment of evil that Hyrule can’t seem to escape, has at times in the past been quite compelling. (Never more so than in <em>The Wind Waker</em>, in which <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://youtu.be/YsPEKgQNGlg\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://youtu.be/YsPEKgQNGlg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">he gives a brief monologue</a></span> that complicates his villainy and makes you wonder about the cost at which Hyrule’s relative prosperity has come.) In <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, unfortunately, he is a one-note villain, his evil simple, without any real character or moral texture. And when you finally vanquish him, the ending largely squanders the potential of the beginning, forgoing any reckoning with loss in favor of a resolution that’s too tidy and light.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">But it’s the journey in <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>that matters most, not the destination, and as a journey, the main quest is often outstanding. It takes you to the far corners of the land, and like its predecessor’s main quest, it sees you connect with representatives of all of Hyrule’s peoples. Unlike its predecessor’s main quest, though, which saw you navigating your way through a number of fairly drab puzzle dungeons and fighting a similar boss at the end of each, here you get a series of much more memorable temples in which combat skills and clever thinking are equally emphasized and which each conclude with a unique and dramatic boss confrontation.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">The quest also sees you navigating a storm-shrouded cluster of sky islands, venturing deep into the Depths below Hyrule, and riding on the back of a massive dragon. In terms of the imagery of it all, the scope and scale of it, it all feels as grand and mythic as you could hope for. <br></p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h89032\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>Side quests and sightseeing</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">And yet that main quest, as great as it is, isn’t what makes Hyrule feel so alive, so rich and vast and lived-in. It’s in your more freeform wanderings—exploring that cave you stumbled upon, or checking out the schoolhouse in town, or chatting with a researcher who’s translating ancient texts the Upheaval has surfaced—that Hyrule comes to feel like a living, breathing world. That phrase is woefully overused when talking about games, but this is a rare instance where it actually applies.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"153eb8c5ef28e0adff0e9bd6fe3d27b8\" data-recommend-id=\"image://153eb8c5ef28e0adff0e9bd6fe3d27b8\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\'A bearded man named Ponthos asks Link, \"Are you really that interested in my orb?\" while a large orb sits in the foreground.\' data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"153eb8c5ef28e0adff0e9bd6fe3d27b8\" data-recommend-id=\"image://153eb8c5ef28e0adff0e9bd6fe3d27b8\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\'A bearded man named Ponthos asks Link, \"Are you really that interested in my orb?\" while a large orb sits in the foreground.\' data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Everywhere you go there are people who need help, maybe with vanquishing a monster or running a group of pirates out of town but just as likely with being reminded of a favorite meal, or figuring out where some missing goats have run off to, or transporting musicians to a particular place for a little impromptu concert. In many games, combat and saving people are just about your only way of directly interacting with and impacting the world around you. Not here. And just as being in the world is its own reward, you’ll typically receive a little something for doing these quests but the real motivation is often just to experience them, to use the tools at your disposal to tackle the problem in whatever way you see fit.<br></p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">But even when you’re not doing one of the game’s 200+ side quests (some categorized as “side adventures”), Hyrule’s beauty, mystery, and danger make it a thrill to explore. I’m particularly fond of building airplanes out of gliders, fans, and control sticks, and soaring to new areas in the sky islands, which really do look and feel like products of another culture, with their floating spheres and strange technology.

I gather their eyeballs and then travel to the hot Gerudo Desert to face off against a Flame Gleeok, one of those three-headed dragons I mentioned. They’re a real pain, but by fusing the eyes of Ice Keese to my arrows, my shots get both homing and ice damage, giving me an edge in the fight. Everything feels connected.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">The late, great Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh often talked about what he called <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/esyQnwz_yJ0\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/esyQnwz_yJ0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interbeing</a></span>, the ways in which we are all always connected to everything around us. In <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>I wander alone, accompanied by what are effectively ghosts of people I know who, by being mere echoes of real people, only emphasize Link’s solitude and my own. And yet <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>always makes me feel deeply connected to Hyrule, and thus to all things. I hunt, I forage, I use the bounty of one region to aid me in another, I build, I create, I destroy, I witness, I take photos and catalog Hyrule’s wildlife. I soar and I spelunk. I help a guy put up signs. Some games are so player-focused that you feel like it’s all about you, like the world revolves around you. In <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, you feel that there is a vast tapestry of life going on around you, and you are just one part of it, as much a part of it as anyone else. I prefer this feeling.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Link, as he has always been, remains a cipher here, someone <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://gizmodo.com/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-link-trans-1850430832\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://gizmodo.com/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-link-trans-1850430832\">any player can seamlessly project themselves onto</a></span>. Through him, we are there. I might play as Kratos in <em>God of War </em>but I’m always aware that I’m very much not Kratos, and that’s fine. Many games benefit from characters with defined, detailed personalities. But the way Link invites any of us in serves these games very well. Link is all of us, and by inhabiting him, we can fully inhabit the world this game offers us, with its stunning sunsets, its misty mornings.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">We often think of games as entertainment, and there’s nothing wrong with a game that just entertains us, but I want art that affects me more deeply too, sometimes. Not too long ago, I read this novel called <em>The Overstory</em> by Richard Powers. It’s a tale of people and environmental crisis but it’s also very much a tale of the natural world, of trees in particular, and after I read it, I couldn’t help but be more aware of the trees I saw everywhere as living things unto themselves. And that, of course, changed how I saw the world, how I saw our fate and the fate of trees as bound up together. <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>doesn’t explicitly try to drive home any such point, and I ultimately found its narrative underwhelming, but games have ways of making meaning that go beyond just the story they tell. There’s meaning in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> giving us a world that’s so full of life, where everyone’s and everything’s fate is interlinked, where you’re encouraged to play in the childlike sense, to use your imagination, to create and experiment and just see what happens.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Like a great novel might, this game made me feel more connected to the world around me, and it put me in touch with feelings of wonder that I haven’t felt in a long time. I’ve often felt that too much is made of the anecdote that Shigeru Miyamoto was inspired to create <em>The Legend of Zelda </em>by <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1655260297685520384?s=20\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1655260297685520384?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">his childhood explorations of Japanese countryside</a></span>. For so long, the series had lacked, in my view, any recognizable shred of real exploration, real play. But then, along comes a game like <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, which gives you both a wonderful world to explore and thrilling, imaginative new ways to explore it, and I get it. Playing this, I feel like a kid again, alive to the wondrous nature of the world, imagining myself on all kinds of incredible adventures. <br></p>', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', 'The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/49c36fadfb062218b6e6c8509909f030.jpg', 'switch', 'https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-the-kotaku-r-1850570840', 'I climb up onto a giant lilypad floating in the middle of a lake and it sinks un...', ''),

That discomfort made me miss the <em>Metroid </em>games, which aren’t necessarily marketed to women, but do, I was surprised to learn at some point, revolve around the nonchalantly female bounty hunter Samus Aran. I loaded <em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em> with these memories in mind, hoping it would let me try a bit of what I missed when I was too young to even really understand what makes someone “a girl” (I’d just turned 4 when it was released for the GameCube in 2002). It delivers.<br></p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h82716\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>The immersive atmosphere of Tallon IV</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Remastered</em> leaves the story of the original untouched.

Shortly after I arrive on the Pirates’ Orpheon spacecraft, copper-colored Tallon IV looking like a shiny penny in the distance, I am encouraged to shoot at enemies with my Pulse Beam. Boom. The Pirates go down. I’m told to press B while using the game’s very generous lock-on setting, which pulls the game’s already basic shooting elements down to their baseboard, to move around potential hits. Boom. A swarm of creatures vomit green goo at me. Some splats and slides off my visor, but I kill the creatures quickly.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">From this benign beginning, <em>Metroid Prime</em> establishes itself as more of a <em>Lara Croft</em>-type adventure than a shooter. Tense moments—the seconds after killing a boss, missing a jump and slipping into a pit of burning magma—are pinches to keep pushing forward, get the next bit of gear, go down another secret tunnel, add more Chozo history to my logbook.<br></p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h82717\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>The same game but better</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It helps that this <em>Remastered</em> version looks so…remastered. I forget that this was first released for the GameCube in 2002, taken by the beads of orange light that peel off of Orpheon like spiderwebs illuminated by the hot sun, taken by its cute, cartoon-y graphics as I progress.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Samus’ eyebrows, through the reflection of her helmet, are perfect bark-colored rainbows. The fallible enemies, some with cases of ice on their backs like turtle shells, some crackling with painful white lines of electricity, and those Space Pirates with their long legs and jet packs, are richly colored like gummy bears.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But <em>Remastered</em> hasn’t forgotten where it came from. Aside from the default “dual-stick,” for modern, dual-stick control, the game offers robust controller settings, including “classic,” modeled after the GameCube controller, “pointer,” which operates “similar to <em>Metroid Prime: Trilogy</em> for Wii,” the game says, and “hybrid,” which combines dual-stick and classic. I play mostly with dual-stick, though I feel like hybrid is a fun limitation, with a sticky up-and-down control that I find beneficial to my motion sickness.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"edfaac60620f9c972f94311bedb08023\" data-recommend-id=\"image://edfaac60620f9c972f94311bedb08023\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2704\" data-height=\"1516\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Samus points a gun in Metroid Prime Remastered.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"edfaac60620f9c972f94311bedb08023\" data-recommend-id=\"image://edfaac60620f9c972f94311bedb08023\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2704\" data-height=\"1516\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Samus points a gun in Metroid Prime Remastered.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I appreciate that, too.

Without it, although rare, annoyances were more difficult to cover in candy.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">As I progress through the game, I pick up expansions to my health bar and to my Power Suit, like a thermal visor, <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://metroid.fandom.com/wiki/Space_Jump_Boots\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://metroid.fandom.com/wiki/Space_Jump_Boots\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">boots</a></span> that help me do moon landing high jumps, and weapon expansions that help me shoot out missiles spun from purple light. The enemies that crowd the different environments I navigate and return to, hunt in, plunder, and return to stay at pretty much the same low-level difficulty because of this. I don’t mind that so much—quickly downing enemies helps make the game feel like an elastic snap, and I like moving on.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But repetitiveness and simplicity become less fun when it comes to the bosses, which either have tricks to them (a light beam you need to change the position of, some rocks you need to methodically obliterate) or require boringly little skill (hold B to avoid an attack, shoot until they die). By my fifth boss battle, I’m more annoyed than exhilarated, wanting to get it over as fast as possible so that I don’t have to double back to my last save station.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I can respect that purists <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/110f58b/metroid_prime_remastered_needs_an_autosave_feature/\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/110f58b/metroid_prime_remastered_needs_an_autosave_feature/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">like the save station</a></span>—the health-replenishing checkpoints are, for the most part, conveniently located in each new place you enter—but, like I said, this is a game that’s all about travel. Adventure, right? But when I trip into magma <em>again</em> and need to retrace 10 minutes worth of my steps, taking down the weak enemies that light that path <em>again</em>, I don’t feel challenged, I feel annoyed. Exploration, the crux of the game, turns into a chore.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">At slower, more frustrating points of my playtime, I find it difficult to connect with the obscurity of Samus’ mission.

I can’t say I’m that personally invested in the Chozo’s demise, and the game isn’t heavy enough on mystery to make me want to be. It’s all pretty cut and dry, evil mutant stuff.<br></p>\n\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Metroid Prime Remastered\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"metroid-prime-remastered\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">To give myself more to chew on, halfway through, I turn on “full” narration settings, so that voiceover from the game’s original European and Japanese releases would play as I do. I’m disappointed when I realize that those old voices are confined to the opening and closing cutscenes, and to announcing locations, like the translated Ice Valley (Phendrana Drifts).<br></p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h82718\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>Samus Aran lives</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I’m more interested in the careful details <em>Metroid Prime</em> uses to make up for its hashing and rehashing (it is a 2002 game, after all). The white-blue snowdrifts in the Phendrana region, the way water sloughs off Samus’ visor like she’s a stone in a river.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">They endear me to Samus, as silent and stoic as she is. Similarly to <em>Alien</em>’s Ripley, Samus is presented as refreshingly gender-neutral, her suit fixed with massive armored biceps, a bit of flat orange metal around her waist, too protective to allow for curves.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Remastered</em>’s graphics look great, and while the game continues to, for the most part, translate well as an expansive, engaging shooter, I’m most struck by how the game allows Samus to be a person. Not a woman with her baggage, sexualized and discarded like a <em>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</em> sex worker from the same year, and not relegated to the background the way 2023’s <em>Dead Space</em> does to its female characters.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Metroid Prime</em> doesn’t linger on Samus’ fear, either, instead allowing Samus to navigate Tallon IV with indifference, something real women walking alone in the real world are rarely encouraged to have. But Samus never needs to hurry because <em>Metroid Prime</em> keeps her safe. And the immediacy in which she gets to exist has nothing to do with her gender. Unless I see her reflected eyes, fluttering with black mascara, in her visor, I’m not thinking about Samus’ gender or what she looks like.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">And I’m thankful for that. I’m old enough now to witness girls partake in the video game industry outside of “girl games,” and to experience its full breadth for myself. <em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em> isn’t as perfect of a game as it seemed to be over 20 years ago. Too much time has passed for that to have ever been the case. But it will always know how to let a woman live.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"> <br></p>', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', 'Metroid Prime Remastered: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/016fdbb7f5748a5887da6c5400229317.jpg', 'switch', 'https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-remastered-nintendo-switch-kotaku-review-1850124313', 'I started growing up with games at a time when a lot of them weren’t advertised ...', '');

Despite the unprecedented popularity of that game, the series’ latest, <em>Fire Emblem Engage</em>, is a return to its fairytale roots. And as I played the game, I realized quickly that <em>Engage</em> was also taking inspiration from another source: the mobile gacha game <em>Fire Emblem Heroes</em>. As Nintendo’s <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-heroes-profits-revenue-nintendo-billion-app-1849134777\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-heroes-profits-revenue-nintendo-billion-app-1849134777\">first billion-dollar mobile game</a></span>, it’s easy to understand why the developers chose that success story to influence their vision of the<em> Fire Emblem</em> multiverse. Unfortunately, what made for a solid mobile game ultimately doesn’t translate well to this console gaming experience. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Fire Emblem Engage</em> is a tactics RPG where you battle magical zombies with swords and sorcery. You play as an amnesiac dragon (in human form) named Alear, who had been asleep for a thousand years. An evil dragon wakes up at the same time you do, and is determined to take over the world with the aid of his powerful minions. Like previous games, the goddess of the world chooses you to save the world. Unlike previous games, you accomplish this by fusing your soldiers with spirits called “Emblems,” who are the protagonists of previous <em>Fire Emblem</em> games. They also haunt physical rings called Emblem rings—which can be lost, stolen, or hidden in inconvenient places. While the main rings are obtained through the course of the story, some optional character rings can also be obtained from an in-game gacha system.</p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"2bf51658f8e7729d7b31f9d1842d6854\" data-recommend-id=\"image://2bf51658f8e7729d7b31f9d1842d6854\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Celine syncs with Celica during battle.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"2bf51658f8e7729d7b31f9d1842d6854\" data-recommend-id=\"image://2bf51658f8e7729d7b31f9d1842d6854\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Celine syncs with Celica during battle.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This isn’t the developers’ first attempt at a <em>Fire Emblem</em> multiverse. Intelligent Systems first experimented with inter-dimensional crossovers in 2012’s <em>Awakening </em>for the 3DS, in which players could recruit classic heroes (albeit without any interactions or dialogue). The 2017 hack-and-slash title <em>Fire Emblem Warriors</em> also featured characters from other worlds, though purist fans don’t consider the musou game as a main part of the franchise. <em>Heroes</em>, however, became an indispensable part of the franchise. While <em>Three Houses</em>, a very successful game by series standards, sold 4 million copies, the mobile game has been downloaded 18 million times. It showed not only that a <em>Fire Emblem</em> multiverse could be successful, but that it might be the most profitable way to sustain a franchise.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The <em>Heroes</em> influence is most readily apparent in the flashy character designs, which make liberal use of bright, contrasting colors and unusual silhouettes. This is tolerable for two-person conversations, but any cutscenes involving three or more characters feel visually jarring. The drastic changes become even more apparent when you watch the new characters fight alongside the classic heroes. Established characters Byleth and Marth have cohesive appearances despite being created nearly 30 years apart. On the other hand, newcomers Princess Ivy and Prince Alfred wear so many clashing accessories, I was frequently distracted by their outfits during emotionally charged cutscenes. They didn’t just seem out of place in a medieval setting; their appearances actively undermined my attempts to take the story seriously. Which is a huge problem for a series that has always tried to seriously wrangle with war themes with varying degrees of success. </p>\n\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Fire Emblem: Engage\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"fire-emblem-engage\">\n\n</section></aside>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The mobile-fication of <em>Engage </em>can also be seen in how the characters communicate with each other. Unlike the lively banter of the previous two games in the series, interactions between characters feel brief and disjointed. Oftentimes the dialogue isn’t even anime nonsense—it’s just nonsense. Discussions end abruptly, or they don’t flow organically. The conversations feel like they’re designed to be screenshotted and shareable on social media, and the overall narrative experience suffers for it. I’ve never felt compelled to skip the dialogue in a <em>Fire Emblem </em>game before. In <em>Engage, </em>however, I lied to myself as I fast-forwarded my way through a couple of support conversations: “I’ll come back to view it later.” Dozens of painfully dull conversations later, I don’t think I ever will. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This is all forgivable in a mobile game where casual players are engaging with dozens of characters in small increments of time, and they don’t have the mental bandwidth for the complexity of a traditional <em>Fire Emblem</em> game. It just doesn’t work, however, for a console game where players expect to be immersed in a world for hours on end. <em>Engage</em> is so shallow about its worldbuilding and characters that I find myself feeling unattached to any of them. When the main character proclaimed that she wants to save the world even at the cost of her own life, I found myself asking: Why? What are the specific things that she believes are worth saving? <em>Awakening</em>’s similarly amnesiac protagonist had a believable redemption arc because the game centered their relationships with other important characters. In contrast, Alear feels like a figurehead to many but a friend to none. There’s a lot of interesting territory to be explored about the detached nature of a messiah’s relationship to their followers, but it never materializes in this game. Again and again, Alear asks their followers to treat them like a friend. Yet the game never shows the small ways in which the characters depend on one another.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">What little character development <em>Engage</em> manages to accomplish is ultimately undone by its clumsy attempts at redeeming its villains. One of its protagonists has an evil, murderous personality caused by psychological abuse. Her cultist abusers pull unbelievable heel-face turns at the eleventh hour, and the victim immediately absolves them of all blame. I don’t <em>enjoy</em> these narratives, but I can buy into a convincing performance. Unfortunately, the voice work just can’t salvage poor writing. There’s one particular endgame scene about motherhood that made me want to shrivel up and die. If <em>Three Houses</em> was two steps forward for mature video game storytelling about warfare, then <em>Engage</em> is ten steps back. Even when a plot twist seems conceptually interesting, the terrible delivery manages to sabotage any sense of gravitas.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The emptiness of <em>Engage</em> feels especially tragic because it had all the fundamentals for a great game. The animated cutscenes are beautiful for a game housed on the ancient Nintendo Switch system, and the live-rendering is better than it ever was in <em>Three Houses</em>. I just wish it had been more consistent about the kinds of stories that the developers were trying to tell. There were moments of grounded realism and motions at emotional sincerity. These were the times when I held my breath and waited for <em>Engage</em> to replicate the magic that drew me to the series over the course of a decade. They never came. Despite the feeble attempts at fan nostalgia, even my favorite characters such as Celica and Byleth felt shallower than they did in their original titles. <em>Engage</em> had all the correct ingredients of a compelling <em>Fire Emblem</em> game—but the script did not break from shallow one-liners or trite melodrama. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"2a20e9c38f9f7e98e43f1374731cefb0\" data-recommend-id=\"image://2a20e9c38f9f7e98e43f1374731cefb0\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Alear is selected on a top-down map.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"2a20e9c38f9f7e98e43f1374731cefb0\" data-recommend-id=\"image://2a20e9c38f9f7e98e43f1374731cefb0\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Alear is selected on a top-down map.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Fortunately, I spent more time <em>engaging </em>with the combat system than the story. Out of all the modern <em>Fire Emblem</em> games I’ve played, <em>Engage</em> feels the most balanced. I thought that the Emblem rings were an annoying gimmick at first. I later came to appreciate that they offered me character customizability without child marriage or eugenics (looking at you, <em>Awakening</em> and <em>Fates</em>). If I decided that I no longer wanted my thief to moonlight as a mage, then I could simply swap her Micaiah ring for a Lucina one. While this system may seem egalitarian on paper, the game still forces you to pick and choose favorites within your army. There are a very limited number of deployment slots per map, and you’ll probably want to pick the royal characters because of their disproportionate plot relevance. This meant that I ended up neglecting over half of my total roster—something that I rarely did in other <em>Fire Emblem</em> games. But <em>did</em> I want to spread the experience equally across 30 people? Probably not. I felt obligated to in prior games because I had conversations to unlock. I didn’t have this problem with <em>Engage</em>, which didn’t give me anything interesting enough to unlock. That’s one way to design around FOMO, I suppose.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I like the improvements <em>Engage </em>makes to the traditional rock-paper-scissors nature of the series’ weapons triangle. <em>Fire Emblem</em> normally tries to balance things by adding or subtracting weapon weaknesses. Magic spells in the classic games would require different types of counters. In <em>Awakening</em>, you’d counter archers with abilities that made it easier to hit archers and dodge their attacks. <em>Engage</em> simplifies the system while retaining tactical complexity. Fists are effective against bows and magic, which still retain the upper hand with their extended range. The lance-sword-axe weapons triangle still exists, but disadvantages hurt more than in previous games. If an enemy hits you with a superior weapon, then your character loses the ability to counterattack for the entire round. That meant that I could no longer send out a beefy armored character to bait attacks during the enemy’s turn like I might in another game. And positioning has become even <em>more</em> important in <em>Engage</em>, where multiple enemies can <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-engage-chain-attack-backup-morion-switch-1850048383\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-engage-chain-attack-backup-morion-switch-1850048383\">chain attack</a></span> you at once. While other aspects of the game have tried to appeal to a more mainstream audience, the combat in <em>Engage</em> remains deep and satisfying. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Like its predecessor <em>Three Houses</em>, <em>Engage</em> brings back the <em>Persona</em>-esque minigames that allow you to train other characters or to spend free time with them. They also seem to be even more optional than in previous games. I didn’t finish <em>Three Hopes</em> because every chapter became a depressing resource grind in which I went back and forth across the map in order to manage upgrades and conversions. This was caused by the fact that I had a limited number of activity points to spend every chapter. There isn’t a similar limit here. <em>Engage</em> offered me a feast of minigames, and the freedom to play them to my heart’s content. I could go fishing, coordinate meals, adopt stray animals after every battle, exercise, or pit my soldiers against each other in gladiatorial combat. The social rewards in <em>Engage</em> feel so negligible or easily obtained that I would complete several consecutive chapters without ever returning to my home base. I know that I complained about the endless activities, but Alear’s castle feels like a step too far out in the other direction. I felt like I had a schedule and a sense of belonging as a professor in <em>Three Houses</em>. For the past forty or so hours, I was funemployed—with all the freedom and boredom that it entailed.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"2fb557d63e27067d34a1006d2d01a37c\" data-recommend-id=\"image://2fb557d63e27067d34a1006d2d01a37c\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Alear has toast dinner with two companions.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"2fb557d63e27067d34a1006d2d01a37c\" data-recommend-id=\"image://2fb557d63e27067d34a1006d2d01a37c\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Alear has toast dinner with two companions.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Social progression feels more casual compared to <em>Three Houses</em> or <em>Three Hopes</em>, where I was constantly rushing to max out some relationship stat before terrible consequences befell certain characters. In <em>Engage</em>, by contrast, the members of my current army barely know their own siblings. I have decided that this is fine. I’ve spent more time trying to adopt stray cats in the countryside than I’ve spent speaking to my own soldiers. <em>Engage</em> doesn’t pretend to be about getting close to those who would risk life and limb for you. Followers are required to worship, but gods are not required to give.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><br>I’ve always believed that mobile games are an <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/diablo-immortal-blizzard-metacritic-f2p-1849059627\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/diablo-immortal-blizzard-metacritic-f2p-1849059627\">approachable gateway for new fans to enjoy an otherwise esoteric IP</a></span>, and <em>Engage</em> streamlines the gameplay in all the right ways. Unfortunately, though, the story falls short of what I’ve come to expect from any <em>Fire Emblem</em> game, and I’m still struggling to understand <em>why</em>. With <em>Fates</em>, the poor writing could be attributed to its sheer character bloat, but <em>Engage</em> has a reasonably normal-sized cast. The watered-down stories felt like an intentional appeal to capture new audiences. But at some point, I want to move on from the appetizer to the main course. With its disposable conversations, shallow handling of themes, and incohesive visual design, <em>Engage</em> is the chicken wing, rather than a full chicken dinner. </p>', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', 'Fire Emblem Engage: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/759a91400dadd924816b90941d59f3ee.jpg', 'switch', 'https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-engage-review-nintendo-switch-three-houses-1850059780', 'With its somewhat more grounded depictions of military life and interpersonal tr...', ''),

I talk big about wanting innovative gameplay but, in a <em>Pokémon</em> title at least, I wanted the familiar comforts of knowing exactly what to do. I wanted up to be north, and down to be south. None of those things were true in<em> Pokémon Scarlet</em>. While struggling to gain a foothold on the frustratingly ambiguous mountainside—one where safe, snowy pathways can be hard to distinguish from treacherous cliffs—I found myself ambushed by a vicious Ice-type Cetoddle who had snuck up in my blind spot. He boinked me, and a battle for my life began.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I’ve played every <em>Pokémon </em>generation since<em> Red </em>on the Game Boy Color, and the basic formula has mostly remained the same. You navigate a labyrinth world connected by routes, battle monsters in a turn-based system, and run around certain tiles until the RNG spits out a Pokémon for you. In <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>, on the other hand, you’re traversing an open world without any routes, you can see potential opponents from far away, and you choose your battles with careful precision. </p>\n\n<aside class=\"sc-o6p93a-0 gJydMU\"><span class=\"sc-196v4ms-0 bpQblS\" contenteditable=\"false\"></span><span class=\"sc-a3cloy-0 bzNnZL\">The shift to open-world exploration has sacrificed the specificity of Pokémon world design. ﻿</span><span class=\"sc-196v4ms-0 bpQblS\" contenteditable=\"false\"></span></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Rather than subjecting you to the tyranny of closed exploration, <em>Scarlet</em> wants to give you more freedom than any title that came before it. Most of the game, you’re traveling on a version-exclusive motorbike Pokémon, Koraidon (<em>Scarlet</em>) or Miraidon (<em>Violet</em>). The Pokémon Center and Pokémarts are located in gas stations. The biggest sell is that there’s no set path that you have to follow. You can go to towns in any order and fight villainous bosses whenever you’d like. Unlike some open-world games, the enemies’ levels do not scale with your own. So if you stumble upon a level 40 Medicham while your Pokémon are level 18 like I did…well, I hope you’ve brought Poké Dolls to distract them.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But <em>Scarlet</em> is a lackluster exploration game. I’ve spent several days in the new region of Paldea, and it’s still as strange and unfamiliar to me as the day I left the starter town of Cabo Poco. Most open-world games rely on strong visual landmarks to help the player find their way. Paldea is largely empty, with very few landmarks on the long stretches of wilderness aside from the occasional gas station. While I was looking for the particularly out-of-the-way city of Alformada, I got lost several times. NPC trainers and signage mocked me constantly. Did you get lost too? Didn’t you know this is the wrong way? I thought the cheeky humor was funny at first. But when I compared my adventure to those in previous Pokémon games, I realized that the series’ transition to the newer design sensibilities had come at a cost.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The shift to open-world exploration has sacrificed the specificity of <em>Pokémon</em> world design. Though every region in past games had dozens of grassy routes, each one felt unique. If you showed me a screenshot of one of those older games, there was a strong chance I could identify where it was taken. Meanwhile, I’ve traveled Paldea for dozens of hours, and I couldn’t tell you anything about the surrounding areas of each city. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Confronted with all this nondescript blandness I thought to myself: What a waste. Maybe it’s because I enjoy traveling in real life. Ever since I was a child, I’ve loved the intricacies of figuring out how to navigate a new place. Roads were places where infinite sky met infinite earth, and every single rest stop was a welcome reprieve, every stranger a spot of humanity. Travel is about learning to love what you might not care for in any other circumstances. But the people I met on the road in Paldea were all NPC trainers. Gas station owners had no role other than to reward me for battling all of the nearby opponents. So it felt like I was “collecting” victories from roadside trainers rather than taking a genuine interest in challenging them organically. And oftentimes, I found myself with my nose to the ground. I’d be watching for sparkling items on the floor, or carefully keeping my eyes peeled for any sudden ambushes from the grass. Even if Paldea had been beautiful, the gameplay discouraged me from looking up and taking it all in.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I know that the central conceit of this series is to find and capture your favorite Pokémon. But if a game tries to offer an open-world experience, then I want to be a tourist. Every bland-looking cliff, every forest, and every river felt more like an obstacle rather than a natural wonder. After a decade, I still think fondly of the solemn tranquility of Mount Coronet from <em>Diamond</em> and <em>Pearl</em>. I remember standing on the peak of Mount Silver and feeling that I stood upon the legacy of giants. In comparison, Paldea’s Mt. Glaseado feels like a steep, ordinary hill. There was no glory in conquering its heights, no sense of having challenged myself to explore its snowy depths. In fact, I often found myself there by accident. World design in previous games felt precise and intentional, funneling me through puzzle dungeons. It was intimate and cozy. <em>Pokémon Scarlet </em>took that away and replaced it with a subpar open-world experience.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"b8649440f3d61d904d24cce6867532a3\" data-recommend-id=\"image://b8649440f3d61d904d24cce6867532a3\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The camera clips through the floor under Skeledirge. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"b8649440f3d61d904d24cce6867532a3\" data-recommend-id=\"image://b8649440f3d61d904d24cce6867532a3\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The camera clips through the floor under Skeledirge. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">And then there are <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-bugs-performance-paldea-nintendo-1849798801\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-bugs-performance-paldea-nintendo-1849798801\">the performance issues</a></span>. Of course, we’ve known about them for a couple of weeks now, and I’d seen them in various tweets and videos. Nothing prepared me, however, for just how hostile the world felt when the camera clipped through an object, or when moving NPCs started stuttering randomly. When I threw a Pokéball, it would often get stuck in midair. While battling an opponent in water, I’d pray that my Pokémon wouldn’t fall into the lake. Although the errors can sometimes be funny, I ended up becoming jaded about the experience over time. I couldn’t trust the camera to follow, or the walls to have proper hitboxes. While I bugged through the floor for the fifth time, I remembered how <em>Kotaku</em> staff had argued about whether or not it mattered that <em>Legends: Arceus</em> looked like ass. Does it matter if <em>Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em> have visual glitches, so long as it’s fun? To me, the answer is a resounding yes. I don’t buy <em>Pokémon</em> games for combat. I play them to simulate the feeling of having cute shared experiences with my Pokémon. As I watched the moonlight turn my electric mouse Pawmot into an unnatural shade of gray, I felt that I wasn’t getting the quality Pokémon experience that I was accustomed to.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Scarlet also lacks the grinding of older generations, which may sound good on paper, but in practice meant that I spent less time being mindful about how I trained Pokémon. I understand this is a longstanding pivot in the series that has taken place over several generations. The developers want you to get through the main story as quickly as possible so that you can get to the endgame of raising the toughest monsters for competitive or multiplayer play, or to be able to spend the whole game breeding shiny Pokémon if that’s your thing. But as I watched my entire party level up at the same time, I felt nostalgic for the days when trying to level a Magikarp was a ritual of love and dedication. Yeah, its nonexistent moveset was a source of frustration. And yes, I had to constantly work to make sure my starter Pokémon’s development didn’t outpace that of their siblings. But a reasonable amount of micromanagement was a way for me to invest care into my favorites. Getting a Volcarona felt awesome because you’d raised a Larvesta from birth to level 59. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Now I just catch a wild Gible at level 40 and shove some EXP candies into its mouth. Or I take my Pokémon out of its ball, and let it battle by itself while I make my way toward our next destination. It doesn’t feel like we endured the struggle together. There isn’t a huge opportunity cost in choosing to raise one companion over another, so I could use new Pokémon at any time without guilt. Which may be fine for players who are new to the series, but I can’t help but feel that they’re missing out on what once made raising each Pokémon feel like a unique experience. If I didn’t want to feel the highs and lows of lugging around a Magikarp in the hopes that it would evolve into Gyarados, then I would have simply left them at the daycare (which raises your Pokémon for you). Now <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em> continue to feel like daycare all the time. Again, this could have been fine if I found exploration to be more compelling than the actual battles. But I didn’t. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The battles are also simply…fine. You know what to expect: Throw out a Pokémon and watch them battle it out in turn-based combat. Paldea adds a smorgasbord of over a hundred new Pokémon to collect, and the roster seems primarily aimed at countering the Fairy-type, which has been fairly overpowered since it was introduced in <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>. I found it extremely easy to pick up powerful Steel and Poison-type creatures compared to other games, and my Fairy-type Dachsbun wasn’t simply steamrolling every single Pokémon I met. I habitually build a team out of new Pokémon only available in that specific generation. If you want a Fire or Water type, then you’re better off trying to catch some of the older Pokémon. With the exception of the new Paradox Pokémon, Paldea isn’t trying to give us new powerhouses like Dragapult or Mimikyu—the new creatures have unique type combinations or special ability gimmicks. </p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"ad3e0f1e9e6f59156bbeca0bba7e6beb\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ad3e0f1e9e6f59156bbeca0bba7e6beb\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A Scyther Terastallizes.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"ad3e0f1e9e6f59156bbeca0bba7e6beb\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ad3e0f1e9e6f59156bbeca0bba7e6beb\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A Scyther Terastallizes.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Tera types, another new addition to the series, are also not very groundbreaking. Terastallizing is a process in which you change your Pokémon’s type to a single mono type (each of which is unique to that specific Pokémon). So one Pikachu’s Tera Type can be Electric, another could be Grass, and a different one could be Dark. There’s a big catch: You can only Terastallize once per battle, and you can’t do it again until you return to a Pokémon Center. So this ability is really nerfed compared to <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>’s Mega Evolution or Gigantimaxing in <em>Sword</em> and <em>Shield</em>. You should only use it in a pinch, but this ability is not suited for long travels or engaging with multiple waves of opponents.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Some special trainers like Gym Leaders will Terastallize their Pokémon in battle, but they only do so for the last Pokémon in their party (and always for their specialized type). So this mechanic doesn’t make gyms any more challenging. I am confident that you could ignore Tera types for most of the game and come out with a pretty okay experience. By the time I made it to the endgame, I had mostly forgotten that it existed. They’re pretty, but don’t expect Tera Types to massively alter your experience. I understand that there’s only a certain amount of complexity that the <em>Pokémon</em> meta can take before it can be difficult for newcomers. But I remember when Pokémon started being able to hold items. When they acquired natures and battles had weather conditions. I remember when the developers were experimenting with triple and rotation battles. I wish that <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em> had been able to introduce a new system that could significantly change how Pokémon were used in battle, and which new combinations are now competitive. It feels as if the developers are reluctant to significantly disrupt competitive play, and casual players get lackluster gimmicks because of it.</p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Pokémon Scarlet and Violet\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"pok-mon-scarlet-and-violet\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>’s story is also not going to blow you away. As usual, it’s just a means of motivating you into traveling the land to battle and collect every Pokémon out there. Allowing players to complete quests in whichever order they chose is unique to the <em>Pokémon</em> games, but it’s not innovative in the wider RPG genre. But <em>Scarlet</em>’s story is nonetheless an improvement over several previous titles because it focuses on the relationships between people, rather than people and their Pokémon.

But it was relatable that Team Star, the primary antagonists of <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>, are committing delinquent acts to keep their friend group together. I was heartsick for these kids even though I wanted to shake them and go “Just talk it out with each other!” And though Arven, the professor’s son who has a strained relationship with his parent, was clearly meant to go from “surly rival” to “my best friend,” I enjoyed watching him slowly open up to other characters in the cast. While I’m unsure about several other aspects of the game, I’m glad that the series’ writers no longer have to rely on trainer-Pokémon bonds to tell compelling stories.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><br>I know, I know, I’ve <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-bugs-performance-paldea-nintendo-1849798801\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-bugs-performance-paldea-nintendo-1849798801\">had my fun</a></span> mocking the visual glitches and performance issues in <em>Pokémon Scarlet </em>and<em> Violet. </em>But I really hope that the performance issues don’t ultimately define how we talk about this generation of games. This isn’t just a game that needed more time in production—Paldea is fundamentally not designed to be pleasant to explore. The open-world mechanics might have felt more novel if I hadn’t also fallen off <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus </em>earlier this year for similar issues with samey world design and unremarkable graphics. <em>Scarlet</em> needed to clear that low bar, and it did not. Maybe by the time the next generation comes along, the series will be able to recapture what makes <em>Pokémon </em>so thrilling in the first place.</p>', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', 'Pokémon Scarlet And Violet: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/f4ecc0e375ab4d0f70cd1bed24c64e2f.jpg', 'switch', 'https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review-nintendo-switch-1849843125', 'While I motorbiked off three consecutive cliffs in Pokémon Scarlet, I was forced...', '');

Now that <em>Bayonetta 3</em>’s here and I’ve finally rolled credits, I kinda wish that it wasn’t made in the first place. Although <em>Bayonetta 3</em> is chock full of shiny new weapons and monsters to test them out on, there’s not enough fanservice in the world to make up for how much of a catastrophic letdown it is, thanks to its garbage fire of a story and its mistreatment of beloved characters. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">PlatinumGames’ <em>Bayonetta 3</em> is a character action hack-n-slash game. You play as Bayonetta, a powerful and fashionable Umbran witch with the power to slow down time with a perfectly timed dodge. Although <em>Bayonetta 3</em>’s launch should be cause for celebration given that it coincides with the series’ <!-- -->anniversary, its legacy won’t be one of triumph; this is the worst game in the trilogy for how it rakes fans over piping-hot coals during the march toward its lackluster finale.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">By and large, <em>Bayonetta</em> games are rollercoaster rides of high-octane action that let you unleash a multitude of satisfying combos upon waves of monsters amid creative combat arenas.

Usually, fans can excuse these shortcomings because they don’t dampen the thrill of the bonkers rollercoaster ride of Bayonetta’s infectious bravado and combat prowess. While <em>Bayonetta 3</em>’s story is easier to follow than usual, it does so much damage to new and old characters alike that it would have been better left untold.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The MacGuffins this time are <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://attackofthefanboy.com/guides/what-are-chaos-gears-in-bayonetta-3/\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://attackofthefanboy.com/guides/what-are-chaos-gears-in-bayonetta-3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the chaos gears</a></span>.

In prior <em>Bayonetta</em> games, chapters felt wholly unique to one another thanks to their inventive setpieces. In one moment you could be fighting a bunch of angels in the Vatican, and the next you’re surfing through a typhoon contending with a giant manta ray. Although <em>Bayonetta 3</em> has its fair share of enthralling setpieces, progressing through <em>Bayonetta 3</em> begins to feel like sleepwalking through the same concepts over and over.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Bayonetta 3</em>’s stages proceed as follows:<br></p>\n<ul data-type=\"List\" data-style=\"Bullet\" class=\"sc-1lmbno3-0 iPScqk\">\n<li>Meet a Bayonetta from an alternative universe</li>\n<li>Witness Alt.

The game features a dedicated waypoint-toggle button so you don’t have to guess which routes lead to bonus items and optional challenges and which lead to story progress. You may want to give the extra stuff a skip, though, as <em>Bayonetta 3 </em>becomes exhausting to play if you try for a completionist run.

While completing these trials does unlock stuff like new items and moves over the course of the game, the flurry of challenges mostly serve as padding to space out <em>Bayonetta 3</em>’s half-baked story.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Visually speaking, <em>Bayonetta 3 </em>isn’t much of a looker. For whatever reason, the graphical artifacts on everyone’s faces make them look like they’re made out of sandpaper, especially in the Switch’s handheld mode. While I usually don’t harp on a game’s graphics, it was hard not to notice that Bayonetta’s model looked smoother and shinier in the eight-year-old <em>Bayonetta 2</em>. <em>Bayonetta 3</em> has a new, barebones photo mode feature, but it seems pointless.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"4aa4286d26c1adbb9ddfff2ae0d5b277\" data-recommend-id=\"image://4aa4286d26c1adbb9ddfff2ae0d5b277\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Bayonetta shoots homunculi while riding the back of an infernal bird demon. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"4aa4286d26c1adbb9ddfff2ae0d5b277\" data-recommend-id=\"image://4aa4286d26c1adbb9ddfff2ae0d5b277\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Bayonetta shoots homunculi while riding the back of an infernal bird demon. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Combat-wise, <em>Bayonetta 3</em> is arguably the best the series has ever been, a pure platinum sparkly statue of the witch herself, if you were to grade it on the game’s combat results scale. One new gimmick in <em>Bayonetta 3</em> lets you take control of demons on the battlefield. However, doing so makes Bayonetta immobile, so you’ll need to be cognizant of where she’s positioned so your combos aren’t unceremoniously interrupted by an attacking enemy.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Another, Demon Masquerade, allows Bayonetta to fuse with her weapons, take on their form, and unleash a flurry of demonic combos at the cost of magic power. My favorite Demon Masquerades were Dead End Express and Ribbit Libido-BZ55l, which <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/bayonetta-3-train-transformation-masquerade-boycott-1849687891\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/bayonetta-3-train-transformation-masquerade-boycott-1849687891\">transformed Bayonetta into a demonic train</a></span> and turned her singing voice into a weapon, respectively. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Demon Masquerade is a much-welcomed addition to Bayonetta’s toolkit, adding a whole new dimension to the game’s combat by letting your domesticated demon start your combos or serve as an exclamation point. The only downside here is how unsatisfying it feels to use these attacks against the uninspired new enemies. </p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"0f98396327e31fe44949ce727bcbcff2\" data-recommend-id=\"image://0f98396327e31fe44949ce727bcbcff2\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Bayonetta bonks the head of a giant spider demon. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"0f98396327e31fe44949ce727bcbcff2\" data-recommend-id=\"image://0f98396327e31fe44949ce727bcbcff2\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Bayonetta bonks the head of a giant spider demon. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Bayonetta 3</em>’s main enemy types are homunculi, artificial constructs created by corrupted humans. Their humanoid forms are a bore to hack through and even less impressive visually because of their bland, neon green <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/growing-up-as-a-taiwanese-american-gamer-was-the-best-o-1844282803\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/growing-up-as-a-taiwanese-american-gamer-was-the-best-o-1844282803\">Pepsiman</a></span> designs. The challenge modes give you a break from the lackluster homunculi by bringing back the infernal demons and angels from prior games, but this backfired in that it just made me long to play <em>Bayonetta 3</em>’s predecessors instead. While the new additions to the game’s combat system managed to coax me out of outright hating the 20 hours I spent playing <em>Bayonetta 3</em>, its storytelling left me questioning whether it was worth the five-year wait.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The one shining light in <em>Bayonetta 3</em>’s story is its new playable character, Viola. Similarly to how Nero was a breath of fresh air for the <em>Devil May Cry </em>series, so too is Viola in <em>Bayonetta 3</em> thanks to her charming personality and killer moves. In contrast to Bayo and Jeanne’s suave and snooty dommy mommy personas, Viola is a clumsy punk rocker girl who trips over her would-be-cool one-liners and bumbles her way through boss battles. However, her antics never cross the line from endearing to grating thanks to how charming she is. Instead of triggering witch time through dodging, Viola parries attacks with her long katana. This takes some getting used to, since prior <em>Bayonetta</em> games taught us to dodge whenever possible.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Unfortunately, Viola’s inclusion is marred by the relatively limited time you get to play as her in comparison to Bayonetta, as well as a major story beat.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"7c24c6a46a3fbe33c7646ddbc29267ff\" data-recommend-id=\"image://7c24c6a46a3fbe33c7646ddbc29267ff\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Viola braces herself for an attack from an infernal demon. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"7c24c6a46a3fbe33c7646ddbc29267ff\" data-recommend-id=\"image://7c24c6a46a3fbe33c7646ddbc29267ff\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Viola braces herself for an attack from an infernal demon. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In chapter seven—the midway point of the game—it’s revealed that Bayonetta and <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://bayonetta.fandom.com/wiki/Luka\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://bayonetta.fandom.com/wiki/Luka\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Luka</a></span>, the failson journalist, are Viola’s parents. Previously, Luka served as a predominantly unreliable character who could only competently serve as comedic relief for Bayonetta to emasculate. But in <em>Bayonetta 3</em>, the Umbran witch treats Luka like a husband she can’t take anywhere, her little mew mew. It’s also revealed that Luka is the werewolf-like infernal beast that gave Bayonetta and Viola trouble in previous chapters, despite him never having that kind of power in previous games.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">While I’d prepared myself for the other stiletto to drop after this bizarre revelation, no amount of prep time could cushion how frustrating it was to witness <em>Bayonetta 3</em> push Luka down my throat both as a big-time player within the franchise and as Bayonetta’s love interest when Jeanne, a better-written character who has much more chemistry with Bayo, was being misused left and right.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Since Bayonetta first debuted in 2009, the lanky witch has been <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.polygon.com/23417059/bayonetta-3-lgbtq-gay-queer-icon-fandom\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.polygon.com/23417059/bayonetta-3-lgbtq-gay-queer-icon-fandom\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an icon in the LGBTQ+ community</a></span>, celebrated by queer fans.

Turns out Dr. Sigurd, a character whom Jeanne was charged with rescuing during a side-scrolling <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>-esque spy quest, was Singularity all along. Even when the game threw Jeanne a bone by giving her something to do instead of being a damsel in distress, it was all to just kill her off, making the time spent during her missions feel pointless. At this point, I opted to skip out on most of the once-enjoyable witch- and time trials and just mainline the rest of the plot so I didn’t need to spend any more time than necessary playing <em>Bayonetta 3</em>.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I could give a gory blow-by-blow on all the ways <em>Bayonetta 3</em>’s third-act plotting fails the character and her fans, but suffice it to say that PlatinumGames let me down one last time by killing Bayonetta off too.

What’s more, it pulls off this feat while telling not just one tale but eight delightful, seemingly unrelated short stories that span space and time.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Live A Live</em>, by Square Enix, is a remake of the 1994 RPG of the same name for the Super Famicom that’s never before received an official western release. While the game presents itself as a rudimentary mid-90s JRPG, <em>Live A Live</em> is brimming with charm and stellar storytelling that would put most HBO shows to shame.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You play as eight different protagonists spanning different eras in human history: prehistoric, imperial China, the middle ages, the wild west, Edo-period Japan, the present day, and the near and distant future. It’s okay if one chapter doesn’t entirely click with you because it’s likely that the next one will. Even when a given chapter seems like it’s not going to be your jam, <em>Live A Live</em> finds a way to breathe life into it with a bountiful array of wacky references and subtle homages sewn within its stories.

In it, you play as a Shifu, a martial arts master approaching the twilight years of his life. In his final days, the Shifu trains three rapscallion pupils in the ways of his dying martial arts in hopes of keeping his craft alive. Throughout their training, you dictate which students require extra rearing in Shifu’s Earthen Heart discipline by sparring with them more often than the others. The pupils, in turn, replicate the moves they learn from Shifu after being bested by him during training. However, the more the three improve, the more Shifu’s fighting ability decreases. Role-playing games so often give us a constantly rewarding sense of progression for all of our experience; here, those mechanics are used to poignantly communicate a sense of aging and decline.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Before their training can bear fruit, a rival school attacks Shifu’s dojo, killing two of his pupils. Not wanting to doom his surviving pupil with the cycle of revenge, Shifu sets out alone for one final battle against the rival school in a <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Death\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Death\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Game of Death</em></a></span>-esque battle, leaving his once-cowardly student behind. I won’t give away how Shifu’s tale ends, but its thematic throughline of imparting life lessons and unearthing the latent potential within people society deems as worthless hits every bit as hard as Shifu’s ultimate technique, Heavenly Peaks Descent.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Even the game’s weaker chapters found a way to keep me engaged thanks to their gameplay gimmicks and homages to popular media in their respective genres. For example, let’s take the present day chapter. Subtitled The Strongest, this tale evokes the structure of wrestling and fighting games as it focuses on one man’s quest to assert himself as the greatest fighter in the world. In pursuit of this glory, he travels the globe, taking on the masters of a variety of fighting disciplines.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"9831284a16455575239961910c3456cb\" data-recommend-id=\"image://9831284a16455575239961910c3456cb\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Masaru Takahara kicks in jubilation after learning the german suplex. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"9831284a16455575239961910c3456cb\" data-recommend-id=\"image://9831284a16455575239961910c3456cb\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Masaru Takahara kicks in jubilation after learning the german suplex. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The cliché structure initially led The Strongest to feel like it was going to be your standard fight-night chapter, but it actually approaches this tried-and-true territory with real cleverness and enthusiasm. The best part: you can bait moves out of your opponents so you can add them into your arsenal. Needless to say, seeing the prompt “German Suplex learned” gave me a visceral sense of accomplishment no other game to date has ever given me. Present Day: The Strongest quickly became Present Day: Suplex City because that move was strong as hell.

Learning the range of both an enemy’s attacks and your own raises the effectiveness of your turns. In the near future chapter, for instance, the best example of efficient tile management comes as you defeat goons with protagonist Akira’s hypnotic psychic powers.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"b7c99a5979a9269afcf6b85dd6993a8c\" data-recommend-id=\"image://b7c99a5979a9269afcf6b85dd6993a8c\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Akira winds up for a psychic attack against a biker gang.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"b7c99a5979a9269afcf6b85dd6993a8c\" data-recommend-id=\"image://b7c99a5979a9269afcf6b85dd6993a8c\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Akira winds up for a psychic attack against a biker gang.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Akira has the ability to read people’s minds. These psychic powers unearth an individual’s inner-most thoughts, but in battle they manifest as powerful, and ridiculous, psychic attacks. Akira’s major strength in the battlefield isn’t his punches or kicks, but his disorienting psychic attacks, some of which he can use on multiple enemies at once. Unlike the knight or rook-style chess movements of <em>Live A Live</em>’s physical attacks, Akira’s psychic abilities affect a generous column of tiles affecting as many enemies as possible. One such attack is Mother’s Shame–an attack that confuses enemies by invading their minds with thoughts of their mothers, causing them to lose the will to fight. Imagine preparing to put hands on someone, and then suddenly reliving in excruciating detail that time your mom tore your ass out the frame for not thawing out the chicken like she asked you to in front of all your friends. How terrifying.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Depending on the type of attack you dish out, you can give tiles elemental damage that chips away at enemies before their turns. For the prehistoric chapter, that means shitting and farting on enemy cavemen and ancient beasts alike. It’s super effective.</p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Live A Live \" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"live-a-live\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Visually speaking,<em> Live A Live</em>, a pretty standard pixel-art JRPG in its original incarnation, has now been given the HD2D treatment of games like <em>Octopath Traveler </em>and <em>Triangle Strategy</em>. The result is occasionally breathtaking, though those moments are mostly thanks to the game’s use of depth of field, bloom effects, and the bonkers sprite detail during its climactic boss fights. However, don’t let the cutesy sprites fool you: <em>Live A Live</em> is rated T<!-- -->, and for good reason.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The game might be called <em>Live A Live</em>, but folks nevertheless die unceremonious, gruesome deaths throughout its multiple chapters, be it at the hands of a vengeful martial artist, a troupe of dastardly bandits, a demonic dinosaur, or perhaps worst of all, a giant chicken kaiju. On the lighter side, <em>Live A Live</em> left me jokingly clutching pearls at the swearing, snarky comebacks, and brutally honest motivations for its protagonists. Hell, the driving motivation for the plucky caveman Pogo and his ape friend Gori in Prehistory: The First involves rescuing a woman and a band of gorillas so the duo can eventually bust their first nut. It be like that sometimes, I suppose. Instead of being tonally jarring, these absurd and light-hearted moments sing as a much-needed counterbalance to the game’s more somber and tragic events.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">And without giving anything away, <em>Live A Live</em> culminates towards a powerful conclusion that will have its time-spanning heroes living on in your memory long after its credits roll…for the ninth time.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">      <!-- -->   <br></p>', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', 'Live A Live: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/6e9ec19d28df459e42ab8a6def3e8513.jpg', 'switch', 'https://kotaku.com/live-a-live-nintendo-switch-review-remake-square-enix-1849338456', 'Live A Live is a pixel-art role-playing game that’s here for a good time, not a ...', ''),

What happens when the Force no longer favors you? Can you survive when you walk away from being the chosen one? <em>KotOR 2</em> shows you the dead, unbeating heart of an endlessly vast and uncaring galaxy. Instead of fully committing itself to space-western fantasy like its BioWare-made predecessor, <em>KotOR 2</em> is a razor-sharp interrogation of whether the <em>Star Wars</em> universe needs to exist at all. It withholds the gentle nostalgia evoked by the <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/lego-star-wars-skywalker-saga-review-kotaku-ps5-xbox-tt-1848746867\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/lego-star-wars-skywalker-saga-review-kotaku-ps5-xbox-tt-1848746867\">most recent <em>Legos Star Wars</em> game</a></span>, and I respect it for demanding my skepticism of its narrative.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">First released in 2004, <em>KotOR 2</em> only had a year of development time, which resulted in a ton of cut content and technical issues compared to its relatively stable predecessor. Back when I played the PC version, you had to install a <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=485537937\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=485537937\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">content restoration mod</a></span> just to view a ton of plot-critical cutscenes. So it’s hard to get too mad about Aspyr’s just-released Nintendo Switch port for being a buggy mess.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I am disappointed, but not surprised, that the Switch port will randomly crash for no apparent reason, or loop a scene repeatedly until I give up and reset the game in hopes it won’t loop next time. Such problems would give plenty of cause to walk away from most Switch games, but as a seasoned <em>KotOR 2</em> player I’ve come to expect these bugs as the cost of admission to Obsidian’s obtuse, messy, and broken galaxy. Even so, it feels a bit egregious that it took two weeks for Aspyr to <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/kotor-2-gamebreaking-bug-aspyr-crash-onderon-1849136189\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/kotor-2-gamebreaking-bug-aspyr-crash-onderon-1849136189\">fix a game-breaking bug</a></span> that <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/kotor-ii-star-wars-aspyr-nintendo-switch-bug-the-sith-l-1849085914\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/kotor-ii-star-wars-aspyr-nintendo-switch-bug-the-sith-l-1849085914\">prevented players from being able to even complete the game</a></span>.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I discovered the Switch port’s best feature by accident: By pressing the left movement stick twice, you can bring up the cheats menu. Here, you can manually add skills, replicate items, jump to certain cutscenes, or zoom around in the free camera view. I found that this was an excellent compromise between staying faithful to the original game and trying to offer a less frustratingly buggy experience. </p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"3b0c486a7605fb401b5d8c7b56f0a9ee\" data-recommend-id=\"image://3b0c486a7605fb401b5d8c7b56f0a9ee\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A Jedi fights multiple soldiers with a lightsaber.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"3b0c486a7605fb401b5d8c7b56f0a9ee\" data-recommend-id=\"image://3b0c486a7605fb401b5d8c7b56f0a9ee\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A Jedi fights multiple soldiers with a lightsaber.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The free camera is by far one of my favorite features: I explored the entirety of Onderon’s royal palace and found that the entire level was hovering in midair. Some games are content to merely poke fun at themselves. The Switch port of <em>KotOR 2</em> fully owns up to its warts, and invites you to explore them at your leisure. Aspyr’s port also restores certain story scenes that were cut from the original, but it was hard for me to remember which ones they were, since I always played the PC version with the content restoration mod. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The Switch port crashes less frequently than the PC version, but you’re not playing this game to experience technical excellence, or to monotonously traverse its sparsely populated environments. You’re playing it because <em>KotOR 2</em>’s cynical, questioning perspective of the galaxy is what we need in an era when all our institutions are falling apart. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">BioWare’s original <em>KotOR</em> has a former Sith Lord save the Republic after initially conspiring to destroy it. In Obsidian’s sequel, a Jedi “Exile” excavates the remnants of a failed war, a failed government, and a failed spiritual philosophy. <em>KotOR 2</em> is much less encouraging about saving the Republic. Crucially, it does not ask you to feel any loyalty toward the galactic federation or the Jedi Order. What do you owe a government that turned you into a weapon? Absolutely nothing. But you can take up your laser sword for your own sake, and you can teach others to do the same.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The game excels by telling multiple stories from the past and the present at once. The best example of this is the Peragus tutorial level, in which the player escapes from a mining facility. An assassin trapped me on the asteroid belt, forcing me to piece together video recordings to learn about his other, murdered victims and potential escape routes; all of that was part of a larger plot orchestrated by a droid’s attempts to “fix” the broken Republic. When I was investigating the ruins of the Sith planet of Korriban, I wasn’t just trying to find a Jedi master in hiding, but also relitigating the protagonist’s role in the brutal Mandalorian Wars, which took place before the<em> KotOR</em> series even began. And I felt terror when I went to investigate some strange signals on the smuggler’s moon of Nar Shadaa, only to find, upon returning, the severed limb of my questgiver. There were no clean answers, except for the ones that I inferred from context clues. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Like any good horror game, <em>KotOR 2</em> thrives on making you feel isolated and uncomfortable. Unfortunately, not every instance of philosophical inquiry sticks the landing. One such misstep occurred when I decided to give money to a beggar on Nar Shaddaa. Instead of responding like a normal person, your mentor says that you’ve weakened him by showing charity. This by itself would have been fine, except the game then showed me a vision of the man being beaten up for his loose change. I laughed at the scene, which came off more hamfisted than thoughtful. <em>KotOR 2 </em>can feel radical and liberating, but those moments coexist with ones like Nar Shaddaa’s, in which the game reproduces the cold, conservative logic of a dying empire. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>KotOR 2</em> isn’t a happy RPG in which everything can be resolved by the power of friendship. The characters reproduce the broken logic of a galaxy that has utterly failed them, and the game is ruthless about letting them fall. Years later, female developers alleged that lead writer and designer Chris Avellone <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/multiple-women-accuse-games-writer-chris-avellone-of-se-1844135498\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/multiple-women-accuse-games-writer-chris-avellone-of-se-1844135498\">had committed sexual misconduct</a></span> while he worked at Obsidian, to which he responded by <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/games-writer-chris-avellone-files-libel-lawsuit-denies-1847186019\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/games-writer-chris-avellone-files-libel-lawsuit-denies-1847186019\">suing them for libel</a></span>. Avellone was not the only writer on the team, but it was nevertheless difficult for me to separate the art from <em>KotOR 2</em>’s lead designer. The game portrays the galaxy in shades of gray, which made the game feel liberating to play as a troubled college student. Now, as a more experienced adult, I’m far more critical of how <em>KotOR 2 </em>represents moral ambiguity, which can often be weaponized to serve men in power. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Nevertheless, the game always hits hard emotionally in a way that no other <em>Star Wars</em> media ever has. My favorite moment occurs near the end, when <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v416Ri38O7g\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v416Ri38O7g\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">your protagonist finally meets the Jedi masters</a></span> who had exiled them from the order. The background music completely fades when the Exile’s mentors explain why they lost their connection to the Force, but it resumes triumphantly when they start condemning their student’s existence as a danger to the galaxy. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">“You were blinded,” accuses the master. In response, the camera abruptly cuts to the Sith Lord Traya, who’s been lurking nearby: “And at last, you saw.” Though these lines aren’t as flowery as most of the script’s, the dramatic irony of the execution lands hard and makes this long-anticipated Dantooine encounter the most memorable scene in the game. </p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords \" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-the-sith-lords\">\n\n</section></aside>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">While <em>KotOR 2</em> almost never takes a specific stance on the extreme perspectives of its traumatized cast, the cinematic techniques it deploys on Dantooine make it clear that the Jedi’s teachings about detaching themselves from worldly concerns are wrong. But the Jedi masters hit the mark with one of their accusations—by slaughtering hundreds of faceless enemies and soaking up all the experience points, your character has indeed become the deadliest, most unaccountable rogue in the galaxy. I admired that <em>KotOR 2 </em>not only acknowledges that RPG mechanic in-game, but is willing to let a character willing to speak to why BioWare protagonists are, on the whole, bad for the galaxy.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Despite your Jedi Exile being the most proficient of killers, <em>KotOR 2</em> is also able to take away their agency by having their mentor manipulate events from behind the scenes. The Switch port retains the scenes in which Darth Traya forcibly manipulates several characters to aid in the protagonist’s quest, all without their knowledge. Traya’s hatred for the Force stems from how the mystical phenomenon actively manipulated history, and yet she regularly uses it to dominate others. Watching her blackmail my friends while the Exile was out of earshot felt horrific. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Yet I also loved that these events fell entirely out of the protagonist’s knowledge or control. In BioWare games the player is typically all-powerful. Given enough time, the “chosen one” protags always become privy to the world’s darkest, most gruesome secrets. But in <em>KotOR 2</em>, your forlorn Exile lacks the galaxy’s mandate. When you’re truly an everyman, you’re subject to being controlled by systems and people more powerful than you. It was fascinating to be privy to information about the Exile that was completely separate from the protagonist’s own awareness. <em>KotOR 2</em> is a sequel to BioWare’s critically acclaimed <em>Star Wars</em> game, but subverts that studio’s protagonist-centric approach to storytelling. There are some secrets that the Jedi Exile will never find out, and that’s not an injustice. That’s just the reality of life. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Near the end of the game, I had a private conversation with one of my party members, Disciple. He was a former Jedi trainee who metaphorically worshiped the Exile. My character opened up about how guilty they felt about leading others into a galactic space war, and expressed doubts as to whether the party members had followed of their own free will. Disciple didn’t wholly convince me that he was totally unaffected by the Exile’s Force sensitivity, but in 2004 it felt transgressive for <em>KotOR 2</em> to interrogate the ethics of RPG protagonism. It still feels relevant in 2022, when even the most ambitious, story-rich games can’t seem to avoid centering themselves around the player. What a very important person they must be.</p>', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', 'Review: Knights of the Old Republic 2 On Switch Is A Buggy, Brilliant Triumph In RPGs', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/ec7ff2757e0e6456a91a3f55179691d5.jpg', 'switch', 'https://kotaku.com/star-wars-kotor-2-obsidian-nintendo-switch-1849318853', 'Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords is a horror story.

While previous titles amounted to breezy <em>Kirby </em>visual novels, <em>Forgotten Land </em>is a Greek epic chocked full of imposing titans Kirby must conquer, and gone are the on-the-rails tours through picturesque side-scrolling landscapes where you overcome enemies with the power of friendship and Kirby’s bottomless lung capacity. Now, you must boldly march into the unknown armed as the throat goat while investing time and resources into upgrading powers of your choosing.

That is until you begin exploring other areas that become increasingly dark.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Areas that were once idyllic paradises transform into hellscapes. Each brave pitter-patter from Kirby’s tiny feet plunges him deeper into <em>Forgotten Land’s </em>progressively harsh climates, barren landscapes, and warmongering wildlife.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The doom-and-gloom lurking around every corner of <em>Forgotten Land</em> is neatly underscored by the game’s foreboding soundtrack. Whether it be an abandoned carnival, a desert vista, or a foggy <em>Silent Hill</em> stretch across a snowy bridge, <em>Kirby</em>’s soundtrack accentuates each land with its own unique vibe.<em> Forgotten Land</em>’s music effectively foreshadows the looming threat hidden in each environment while being pretty damn catchy to boot.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy\" data-recommend-id=\"image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"88\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Spoiler warning image for Kirby And The Forgotten Land. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy\" data-recommend-id=\"image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"88\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Spoiler warning image for Kirby And The Forgotten Land. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Forgotten Land</em> makes it clear that the entire game is just one extended rescue mission.

There are Treasure Hunt time trials for platforming fans, collaborative play for those who don’t want to go it alone, and of course, the optional open-world objectives that will make a completionist’s heart sing.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">All of these elements can help in your mission, whether that’s in the form of upgrades, a helping hand in fights, or acquiring new loot. But <em>Forgotten Land </em>never forces you to delve into these playstyles, leaving you to make the game your own.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"1d77c10b52a5978fc46cf99d3624371e\" data-recommend-id=\"image://1d77c10b52a5978fc46cf99d3624371e\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Kirby knocks back a mole rat after erupting from the ground with a drill strapped to his head.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"1d77c10b52a5978fc46cf99d3624371e\" data-recommend-id=\"image://1d77c10b52a5978fc46cf99d3624371e\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Kirby knocks back a mole rat after erupting from the ground with a drill strapped to his head.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The game entices you to at least try exploring the different objectives, though, with a smart use of cues at the start of levels. Players are prompted with messages like, “There are five objectives you can complete,” which encouraged me to scour every crack in the wall or mysteriously-Kirby-shaped anomaly for a hidden pathway or mysterious item.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">While <em>Kirby </em>games aren’t known for their difficulty, <em>Forgotten Land </em>adds a sense of nuance to traversal and combat. After completing an area, the game reveals objectives that you missed like finding a secret pathway or defeating a boss with a specific power without being hit or floating off the ground. Though you can mainline the game by blitzing through areas like skipping through a board game, the game’s optional objectives transform into a checklist that encourages more thorough exploration of the game’s 3D world and mastery of Kirby’s abilities. But the game more heavy-handedly encourages this growth through its Treasure Hunt side quests.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Though I initially dreaded Treasure Hunts for dropping me into an obstacle course devoid of the game’s many inventive worlds, they quickly became my favorite aspect of <em>Forgotten Land</em> for the challenge they presented when my<em> </em>brain-rotten <em>Devil May Cry-</em>esque swordsmanship<em> </em>made the first couple of worlds a cakewalk to get through. It also didn’t hurt that grinding through them allowed me to quickly level up my go-to Kirby powers.<br></p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Kirby And The Forgotten Land\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"kirby-and-the-forgotten-land\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">That being said, <em>Forgotten Land </em>isn’t without its issues.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The platforming can be finicky. While a running start before jumping would usually give you more distance, <em>Kirby</em> interprets that input as you walking forward with no intention of jumping, leading Kirby to take the plunge into the unforgiving depths. Platforming <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=no%20johns\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=no%20johns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Johns</a></span> aside, you can rest assured that each stumble and stride during the trials and tribulations of Kirby are generously rewarded in <em>Forgotten Land</em>’s bombastic finale.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">And while <em>Forgotten Land</em> is rich with hazardous landscapes and foreboding music, it is bereft of compelling new characters.

Prior to <em>Forgotten Land</em>, he was portrayed merely as a lazy, unjust king. But <em>Forgotten Land</em> breaks the mold by giving the old curmudgeon a chance for redemption in a stunning “Go ahead, I’ll hold them back” scene that could have been pulled straight from an action film.<em> </em>Subtle moments like Dedede’s chivalry or Kirby’s many bug-eyed surprised faces provide short-hand characterization and provide much-needed levity in between Kirby’s treacherous globetrotting. And he’s essentially the last vestige of humanity before bonkers space shit happens<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Finally,<em> Forgotten Land</em>’s final act is balls-to-the-walls high-octane action alongside some <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/kirby-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-hal-laboratory-cre-1848759736\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/kirby-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-hal-laboratory-cre-1848759736\">third-act smörgåsbord of elements</a></span> that evoked thoughts of <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_(1988_film)\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_(1988_film)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Akira</em></a></span>, <em>Bayonetta, </em>and even <em>Halo 3</em>. While any other game’s attempt at such an overblown twist might buckle under the weight of its own ambition, <em>Forgotten Land</em>’s<em> </em>finale never did. Because Kirby is already an eldritch horror himself, everything within <em>Forgotten Land</em>’s bat-shit crazy ending felt like a slow boil of concepts the game drip-fed you until finally blowing its lid in spectacular fashion showcasing every gameplay mechanic at its maximum potential within the final act.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">From its rapture beginnings to its M.

Bodies and ghosts alike still pump through streets, subway stations, and the city’s other familiar arteries. They cross long-forgotten leylines, producing a new arcane geometry—all cell phones, nameless gods, and hungry demons. The God of this world may be dead, but the cities are not.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The <em>Shin Megami Tensei </em>series is the flagship franchise of Atlus, a Japanese publishing juggernaut. However, despite its cult following, impeccable gameplay, and unparalleled character design, the series has yet to firmly cement itself in the U.S. gaming consciousness. Instead, its spinoff series <em>Persona</em> has come to define many people’s idea of the modern JRPG. But even when overshadowed by the series it started, <em>Shin Megami Tensei</em> remains defiantly strange—and <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em> may be the series’ best game yet.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The franchise is known for its rewarding, expansive, and tough-as-nails combat, its terse, nuanced writing about faith, philosophy, and power, and some of the best (and most psychosexual) enemy designs in the entire medium. <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em> embodies every one of these aspects in spades, iterating upon and refining them while never demanding that a player be familiar with the games that came before it. I believe it can mark not only a turning point for the series’ narrative and thematic core, but for its place in the mainstream gaming canon.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">All of this in spite of the dozens of hours I lost to its barebones save system.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em> opens with an eight- to ten-hour trek through the desert, following a short introduction set in modern Tokyo. It is, much like all of the sand, incredibly abrasive. The tutorial lasts about two hours total, a fact I learned very well by repeating it almost four times because I kept forgetting to save after completing it—only to be absolutely ruined by a surprisingly difficult encounter. <em>Shin Megami Tensei </em>does not have any auto-saving or checkpoints. My actual playtime is about 15 hours more than what the in-game clock tells me.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You play as a Nahobino, a fusion of human and demon that has the potential to grow into a god. Early on, <em>SMT V </em>establishes that the Abrahamic God, referred to as YHVH throughout most of the series, was just one of many truly divine beings, referred to as Nahobino, composed of equal parts Knowledge and Life. However, YHVH eventually stripped his fellow divinities of their Knowledge—which was then passed on to humans when we ate from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. YHVH then altered the laws of the universe to prevent the fusion of humans and demons, preventing any potential Nahobino from challenging Him.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 khcaUW\">\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"f3b1b3fd2ec4173b5f9ef69ca277954f\" data-recommend-id=\"image://f3b1b3fd2ec4173b5f9ef69ca277954f\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Abdiel, one of God\'s angels, asks the player if they went against God\'s law.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"f3b1b3fd2ec4173b5f9ef69ca277954f\" data-recommend-id=\"image://f3b1b3fd2ec4173b5f9ef69ca277954f\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Abdiel, one of God\'s angels, asks the player if they went against God\'s law.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In the second chapter of the book of Genesis, God creates two humans—Adam and Eve—who wander the Garden of Eden. They cannot die and their every need is satiated. There is, however, one rule. They cannot eat the fruit from a particular tree, which contains knowledge of good and evil. One day, Eve, after being convinced by a serpent, eats the fruit and both Adam and Eve are cast out of heaven and rendered mortal. Most people would tell you that she was tricked into eating the fruit—but I don’t think I would call what happens to Eve a trick.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The serpent’s core argument is simple and compelling. “God knows the truth of good and evil. Don’t you want to be closer to God?”<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I don’t know how you can fault her for wanting that.<br></p>\n\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 khcaUW\">\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">After a few hours, the game reveals that God was petty and cruel and that he has been dead for 18 years. Then, <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em> asks you a difficult question: What do you do with the absent throne of creation?<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">To answer this question, you spend a lot of time fighting angels and demons alike using the series signature “Press-Turn” battle system, which it introduced in <em>SMT III: Nocturne.</em> It remains possibly the best turn-based combat system in the entire medium.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It is, on its face, pretty simple. Demons have elemental affinities—targeting their weaknesses or landing a critical hit grants an extra action and missing an attack or using an ability that a demon is immune to will take away two actions. The same rules apply to both you and the demons you face.<br></p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Shin Megami Tensei V\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"shin-megami-tensei-v\">\n\n</section></aside>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You and your three demonic companions, which you can recruit through a mix of conversation trees and gifts during any random encounter or fuse from those who have already joined you, begin every turn with one action. This means that any given turn can have between one and eight total actions if you repeatedly crit or hit an enemy’s weakness. If that sounds like a lot, it is. However, you often need all eight of those actions to survive the game’s brutal encounters. The battle system works both ways, after all.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The <em>Shin Megami Tensei </em>series has a reputation for its astonishingly difficult, “unfair” boss fights—this reputation is both inaccurate and well deserved. But of course it is difficult; you are fighting cast-off, lonely, and broken gods, after all. You are challenging the bones of the world itself.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Encounters can be incredibly difficult—even the assorted enemies wandering the game’s overworld can wipe your party if you aren’t paying attention—but they are rarely unfair, on account of the massive toolkit the series gives you access to.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Defeating a <em>Shin Megami Tensei</em> boss usually isn’t a matter of execution but planning, which is why the series can appear unfair to new players. Your first attempt at a boss, unless you’re extremely lucky or clairvoyant, will not go well. They will have unreasonably powerful attacks, you won’t know their weaknesses, and they will likely outlevel you. Grinding will not solve this problem either—unless you manage to significantly outlevel a boss (10 levels or more) you will still get your ass kicked if you go into a fight unprepared. This is where the series’ signature Fusion system comes in handy.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You acquire almost every demon in the game in one of two ways (excluding some demons who join you after quests): negotiation and fusion. Negotiating with demons requires you to convince them to join your party through a mix of conversation and bribery. These demons will be standard and pretty underwhelming. Fighting a boss with a negotiated demon will not go well unless you’ve sunk a lot of time into leveling them up and they’re a natural fit for that particular boss, which is extremely rare. Fused demons, on the other hand, are much more reliable.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"865edaaf5012852e715a41b1ade506d0\" data-recommend-id=\"image://865edaaf5012852e715a41b1ade506d0\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot of the game\'s fusion system, depicting the demon Mada being fused.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"865edaaf5012852e715a41b1ade506d0\" data-recommend-id=\"image://865edaaf5012852e715a41b1ade506d0\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot of the game\'s fusion system, depicting the demon Mada being fused.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">By sacrificing two (or sometimes more) demons at the Cathedral of Shadows, you can summon a new, more powerful demon. The resultant demon can retain some of its predecessor’s skills, stats, and experience points. The list of fusible demons will always be longer than the ones available to you via negotiation in any given area. This allows you to fuse demons with the exact skills and affinities to best handle a given boss fight.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Shin Megami Tensei</em> doesn’t just ask you to use its fusion system though, it demands that you abuse it. For example, fusion has a handful of rules—the most frequently invoked of which is that you cannot fuse a demon with a higher level than your player character. This rule is designed to prevent you from fusing outrageously powerful demons in the early game. However, there are ways to subvert this rule. You can pass stats and experience points down through the fusion system, which means that you can artificially increase the power of a given demon. Sure, you can fuse a normal Level 44 Black Frost with 40 Strength, it’ll do all right in combat; or, you can use pre-leveled demons with boosted stats to get a Level 47 Black Frost with 50 Strength, an unreal set of passive skills, and no weaknesses to absolutely shred a boss.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">When you go from getting absolutely rolled by a boss, to obliterating them with a team of highly specialized demonic weirdos, it is incredibly satisfying. <em>Shin Megami Tensei V </em>believes the only way to beat a god is to build a better one.<br></p>\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 khcaUW\">\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Washing Away of Wrongs</em> is a contemporary art installation formerly on view at the Cleveland Art Museum. The piece is composed of two sealed dryers, each of which contains an aromatic. The smells are designed to evoke an intense emotion in the audience. I have visited the exhibit three times with three different groups of people and I haven’t seen it fail once.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The first dryer is nostalgic and gentle. The second makes people weep. It is wet, earthy, and rotten. It does not sting the nose. The tears are not a physiological response. I wonder what could’ve happened, what tragedy was so great as to stain our generational memory—what could bring me to tears, thousands of years removed from the violence. I often wonder if this is what a dead god smells like.</p>\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 khcaUW\">\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"f1124c24467bde00c3fc33b555316da1\" data-recommend-id=\"image://f1124c24467bde00c3fc33b555316da1\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Aogami, the proto-Fiend of Bethel who the protagonist fuses with to become the Nahobino, offers his hand to the camera.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"f1124c24467bde00c3fc33b555316da1\" data-recommend-id=\"image://f1124c24467bde00c3fc33b555316da1\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Aogami, the proto-Fiend of Bethel who the protagonist fuses with to become the Nahobino, offers his hand to the camera.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In addition to the fusion system, you’ll also rely on Miracles and Apotheosis to give you an edge in combat. With the throne of God empty, your status as a Nahobino gives you the power to alter both demons and the laws of reality itself.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>SMT V </em>introduces essences, which are effectively the raw skills and affinities of a given demon in item form. The essence of Power, for example, is weak to Dark attacks, immune to Light Attacks, and has a variety of Light-based skills. Through Apotheosis, you can grant these skills to any demon regardless of how they were fused. This opens up demon customization in a really exciting way. Combining Apotheosis and Fusion can allow you to make some absolutely unreal demons.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Additionally, the Nahobino has the unique ability to take on the affinities of any demon. If you’re struggling with a particularly hard boss, you can just grant the Nahobino an immunity to its most powerful attacks. It is a really welcome addition to the series that allows for you to be a lot more fluid with the skillsets of your demons.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Miracles are passive abilities which you can purchase with Glory, a resource you find scattered throughout the game’s environment. Miracles cover the basics like how many skills your demons have, how much items cost in the store, and what attack types your Nahobino is best at using, but also allow you to modify more fundamental mechanics like how demons pass down experience points, what generates Magatsuhi (a resource which allows for extremely powerful Omagotoki skills), and so much more. It is a great expansion of the App system introduced by<em> SMT IV</em> and <em>SMT IV Apocalypse</em>.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This isn’t the only way <em>Shin Megami Tensei V </em>builds on its predecessors though. The game is a thematic and narrative successor to <em>SMT IV Apocalypse</em>, which (spoilers) ends with you killing the Abrahamic God, but feels like a spiritual successor to <em>SMT III: Nocturne</em>. The Nahobino resembles <em>Nocturne</em>’s Demi-fiend, and most of the game takes place in a blighted, apocalyptic version of Tokyo that has been rendered almost unrecognizable and contains very few humans. Both games are decidedly lonely. However, I think that <em>SMT V </em>manages to pull off this lonely atmosphere much better through its use of contrast.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>SMT V</em> takes place in two different Tokyos: contemporary Tokyo and post-apocalyptic Tokyo. This allows the game to have its lonely cake and eat it too. By having more human interaction and character motivations in contemporary Tokyo, the strangeness and cruelty of apocalyptic Tokyo feels so much more significant. Your character, as a fusion of human and demon (similarly to the Demi-fiend), is an embodiment of both worlds, and the game uses this to great effect narratively and thematically.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">However, in attempting to fuse two Tokyos, <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em> underprioritizes its human heart. In the game’s first major “you’re no longer just wandering a desert” plot beat, <em>SMT V</em> tries to tell a story about bullying. There is a girl who is bullied. You’re close with her friend who is worried about her. The bullied girl is, unsurprisingly, possessed by a demon, and then all hell breaks loose.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"1b163bc7d43357fc238e3043cde79a68\" data-recommend-id=\"image://1b163bc7d43357fc238e3043cde79a68\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Dazai, one of the game\'s primary human NPCs, is filmed by his friend before entering a tunnel.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"1b163bc7d43357fc238e3043cde79a68\" data-recommend-id=\"image://1b163bc7d43357fc238e3043cde79a68\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Dazai, one of the game\'s primary human NPCs, is filmed by his friend before entering a tunnel.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">There were several moments throughout this arc that I knew were supposed to affect me. Desperate pleas, tearful confessions, and tragic deaths were everywhere, but they lacked emotional weight. The moments themselves are well executed upon—the camera holds perfectly on pierced ribs, slow falls, and pathetic cruelty, and the music hits just right. The problem is that you’ve known these characters for all of 30 minutes. In comparison to the eight to ten hours you’ll spend on your first journey into the Netherworld, the setup for the game’s first major arc only lasts between 30 minutes and an hour depending on your reading and listening speed.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>SMT V</em>’s pace rapidly oscillates from breakneck to glacial, and the experience can be deeply disorienting at times. I wish the game had given me more time early on to shift between the demon and human worlds, to see how one touches the other. Instead it just uses underdeveloped tragedy to send you on its next quest.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">And yet despite all of that, <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/shin-megami-tensei-vs-demons-are-cheeky-little-bastards-1848092492\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/shin-megami-tensei-vs-demons-are-cheeky-little-bastards-1848092492\">I cannot help but love this game’s writing</a></span>. While the human characters can feel like quick caricatures, some of the demons you encounter are given the time and space to have some really great moments—particularly former gods, whose closeness to humans gives them just enough relatability for the divine horrors which befall them to work.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I mentioned previously that <em>SMT V</em>’s other divinities had been stripped of their godhood by YHVH, which creates some great story moments for fallen and falling gods. In the first part of a major side-quest line relating to the Egyptian gods, Isis asks you to hunt and kill a corrupted version of her own son in the hopes that he can be reborn sane. She shows genuine care for him, and the Egyptian god’s recurrence throughout the story lets you get to know them.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Demons are also given the chance to have much bigger personalities than their human counterparts. Most human NPCs are pretty subdued or clearly fall into a genre staple archetype. There’s the coward who wants to fight, there’s the cool older dude who is impressed by your developing skills, and there’s your gentle but firm commander. All of these characters are executed upon well, but they’re a bit paint-by-numbers. The demons, however, are a bunch of wacky weirdos and I love every one of them.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Demons are, without fail, big swings. They are funny, sad, and deeply erratic, and it works so well for the game’s tone. From your negotiations with demons to your interactions with the game’s scattered NPCs, <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em> is consistently weird, which I am deeply grateful for. And when demons aren’t shitposting at you, they’ll probably be shouting philosophy in your general direction. This could be cringey but, luckily, <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em> actually has interesting things to say about identity, selfhood, and power.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"821d22205dcf72bdb68e0ec2baf4870c\" data-recommend-id=\"image://821d22205dcf72bdb68e0ec2baf4870c\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The Nahobino summons a massive wave to crush the enemy.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"821d22205dcf72bdb68e0ec2baf4870c\" data-recommend-id=\"image://821d22205dcf72bdb68e0ec2baf4870c\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The Nahobino summons a massive wave to crush the enemy.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Shin Megami Tensei </em>games have always been about power—how it is wielded, and how it is structured. The battle between the frequently libertarian forces of Chaos and the monstrously authoritarian forces of Law have always been the heart of the series. However, unlike previous games, <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em> takes place after the battle has ended.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em> understands, better than previous games, that systems outlive the people who build them. The God of Order is dead and in spite of this his army still stands—they still wage their doomed war. They cannot even admit that he’s dead.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Starting after the battle has ended allows <em>Shin Megami Tensei V </em>to more directly answer the question posed by every other game in the series: What comes after the revolution?<br></p>\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 khcaUW\">\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The Oven of Aknhai is a story from the Talmud set in the second century CE. In it, a group of rabbis debate the application of a particular law from the Torah to a new type of oven. One rabbi argues that the new oven is ritually pure, the others disagree. When he becomes frustrated, the dissenting rabbi calls out to God to show proof that he is correct. In response, a tree leaps from the ground. The rabbi, rightfully, takes this as an indication of God’s will. When the other rabbis do not accept the argument, he continues to call on God to prove his position through miracles. Miracles happen without fail. Eventually, the voice of God himself calls down that the dissenting rabbi is correct. The other rabbis respond that the Torah is not in heaven. It was granted to human hands, for humans to interpret.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">When God witnesses this he laughs and says “My children have triumphed over Me; My children have triumphed over Me.”<br></p>\n\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 khcaUW\">\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In <em>Shin Megami Tensei</em>, gods and demons alike are created by humanity’s belief in them. They are the products of the stories we tell. Gods, built by our own hands, shape our lives.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Systems, and stories, outlive the people who made them—they twist and writhe and change the lives of the people who follow. Sometimes they grow so big that they feel inevitable, ceaseless. They become unending cycles and wars without generals—they become mistaken for the laws of nature itself. The war between Law and Chaos was built to serve a function, to maintain order—that function has since become unnecessary. A violent and unjust world can be reimagined through the same tools that built it.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In the last two years, across the globe and in the U.S. in particular, we’ve seen people failed by their states time and time again in the wake of a global pandemic. Failed by the bigger-than-us things that we, supposedly, built to protect us. And when they failed, people didn’t. If 2020 and 2021 are remembered for anything but their death count, I hope it’s the mutual aid that kept that number from being so much higher. All the grocery deliveries, rent strikes, and protests that brought cities to their knees were organized by people, not systems.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em> believes in humanity’s capacity to change the world around us—possibly more than any other game in the series. I just wish it had given its human characters more time to actually make that argument.</p>', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', 'Shin Megami Tensei V: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/67827ef35f388b67f78b0c9f417f49d8.jpg', 'switch', 'https://kotaku.com/shin-megami-tensei-v-the-kotaku-review-1848102235', 'Shin Megami Tensei V takes place in two Tokyos—both are real, despite what the a...', ''),

And it does.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Happy Home Paradise</em> focuses on the designing aspect of <em>Animal Crossing</em>, something that <em>New Horizons </em>did much better than any of its main game predecessors. That’s both an asset and a limitation for the DLC. The <em>Animal Crossing</em> community has certainly embraced the decoration features, as evidenced by the massive number of island tours or custom designs highlighted on social media. But it also means that it offers very little if anything to those who aren’t into decorating.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But I am, so I’m here to tell all you other virtual designers that <em>Happy Home Paradise</em> does the job. It’s very well-executed, building on the features and general tone of <em>New Horizons</em>. You’ll “go to work,” as the game literally puts it and solicit clients who will paint a picture of the vision they have for their dream vacation home. You then get to choose the location and can set the scene with the season and time of day of your choice. From there, you decorate the interior and exterior, with only a few required items to check off but are mainly left to your own imagination.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The best clients are highly specific. Like Sprinkle, a penguin who wanted a “Castle of Cold.” Naturally, I put her in an icy spot in the middle of winter, decked out her space with ice sculptures, and polished it to bits to give the ice some extra sparkle. The polishing mechanic even gets an upgrade where you can add new effects to furniture items like a chilly puff of condensation. You can bet I’ll be back to Sprinkle’s icy abode to add that in.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"9c53448c2ee74fdfda0acdeff39f17ca\" data-recommend-id=\"image://9c53448c2ee74fdfda0acdeff39f17ca\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot of character Sprinkle in her Castle of Cold, an assignment in the Happy Home Paradise DLC.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"9c53448c2ee74fdfda0acdeff39f17ca\" data-recommend-id=\"image://9c53448c2ee74fdfda0acdeff39f17ca\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot of character Sprinkle in her Castle of Cold, an assignment in the Happy Home Paradise DLC.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s a slow burn, meaning that, much like the rest of the game, you can’t unlock everything at once. Rather than feeling frustrating, the doling out of new material makes you feel like you’re growing in this new role or at least barred from marathoning the new content until you lose interest. While you work your way up with promotion and raises (we love fair compensation), you’ll also start unlocking more features. You can shine furniture to add new effects, change room sizes, build partition walls, and even design facilities like a school in addition to vacation homes. Plus, the items you unlock with each new design are saved for use in the future, giving you more possibilities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Often as I played along in the main game, I found myself intrigued by certain objects but knew I would never use them. I liked seeing others make themed rooms online or set up sections of their islands as gas stations or cityscapes. But it didn’t feel like me. And I wasn’t going to change how I wanted my island or home to look just because those items were there. But <em>Happy Home Paradise</em> forces you to look beyond your own aesthetics by giving your prompts unique to each villager. It was more exhilarating even to try out something I would never do in my own home. And the challenges that did suit my style were equally rewarding because I got to play with a host of items, whether they were in my catalog or not and change their swatches at my will. It sparked so much inspiration and let me know what things I should take to Cyrus on Harv’s Island for a makeover.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">However, what I liked most about playing through <em>Happy Home Paradise</em> was that I never felt like I was set up to fail. Yes, I got more features to spruce things up as I progressed, but that didn’t stop me from feeling like I did well on my first go around. You’re always given what you need to succeed, and the option to go back and change things up later is freeing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Though I was somewhat put off by the lack of a solid grading system, I increasingly realized how much more uninhibited I felt actually playing the game. It seems you would have to purposefully try to have a bad outcome where a villager doesn’t like your design, so I was often left wondering whether I was actually doing a good job or if the game was just super easy. But when I was actually playing and designing and creating, I was unafraid to dip into pieces that weren’t in the “order” section, which is basically a list of recommended items. I also didn’t feel pressured to use all the tacked-on features if they didn’t feel suited to the space I was making.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Those features, the partition walls, soundscapes, and polishing, also make their way into the main game, both when working on your home and in Photopia (a photo studio on Harv’s Island). And if you’re already the type of player who likes to get creative with their home, this alone makes <em>Happy Home Paradise</em> more than worth it. You can’t, however, change room sizes in your own home or in Photopia. Still, the possibilities between the <em>Happy Home Paradise</em> features and the 2.0 update, breathe so much new life into the game.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"2d8697b381697e57f9f9901ceddbe162\" data-recommend-id=\"image://2d8697b381697e57f9f9901ceddbe162\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot from Nintendo Happy Home Paradise DLC for Animal Crossing: New Horizons.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"2d8697b381697e57f9f9901ceddbe162\" data-recommend-id=\"image://2d8697b381697e57f9f9901ceddbe162\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot from Nintendo Happy Home Paradise DLC for Animal Crossing: New Horizons.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">There are also DIY recipes to find along the shores of the island you visit to build a new home, as well as vines and glowing moss, which can be found on certain island tours Kapp’n takes you on in the latest update. You’re also paid in Poki, a unique currency to<em> Happy Home Paradise</em> and its archipelago. With it, you can buy rare furniture in the office showroom, and the selection changes every day. I would always work enough jobs to buy up the stock, whether I actually wanted the items or not. If I thought I could use the piece in my home, great. If not, it was an easy sell back to the Nooks. You can also buy items on credit eventually if you’re short on Poki because <em>Animal Crossing</em> just loves saddling its players with debt for some reason.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I try not to go into games of DLC with high expectations, lest those hopes be dashed. And <em>Happy Home Designer</em>, the spiritual predecessor to this expansion that also inspired many of the design mechanics that came with <em>New Horizons</em> at launch, seemed well-enough received. But the Nintendo 3DS side game seemed largely ignored. But <em>Happy Home Paradise</em> rose to the occasion, especially for a design-loving player like me.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If interior, or even exterior, designing is not your thing at all, this is an easy skip. But for nearly all other players, I would easily recommend picking <em>Happy Home Paradise</em> up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"> <br></p>', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', 'Animal Crossing\'s Happy Home DLC Isn\'t Just Worth Buying, It\'s A Must-Play', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/cd3bd749dfd9d89bdeab4b0087241490.jpg', 'switch', 'https://kotaku.com/animal-crossings-happy-home-dlc-isnt-just-worth-buying-1848015955', 'As the first and only paid DLC, Animal Crossing: New Horizons’s Happy Home Parad...', '');

If a game is genuinely going to conjure a sense of dread, as <em>Metroid Dread</em>’s title seems to promise, I think it needs to be thorny and aggressive and hostile in ways I wasn’t convinced the Nintendo of 2021 could deliver. Boy, was I wrong to doubt: <em>Metroid Dread</em> is a game with conviction. It is committed to its efforts to put you on edge, to deny you a feeling of sheer domination over your adversaries and your environment, and for that, I applaud it. However, it also lacks the immersive, atmospheric pull of the most beloved <em>Metroid </em>games. The result is a somewhat cold game that possesses a raw technical prowess I intellectually admire, but not the <em>Metroid </em>magic it needed to win over my heart.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">As <em>Dread</em> begins the Galactic Federation dispatches intergalactic bounty hunter Samus Aran to the uncharted planet ZDR. The heavily armored E.M.M.I. androids that preceded her have gone silent, but the strange world may hold clues about the virulent X parasite. Samus being immune, she’s the natural choice for such a dangerous mission.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/hands-on-metroid-dreads-first-hour-is-legit-kinda-terr-1847742944\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/hands-on-metroid-dreads-first-hour-is-legit-kinda-terr-1847742944\">As I wrote</a></span> after playing about an hour of the game, <em>Dread</em>’s beginning is wonderfully destabilizing. You promptly find yourself stranded deep in the cavernous innards of ZDR, stripped of your powers after getting your ass handed to you by a mysterious Chozo warrior. As you communicate with your ship’s computer Adam, your mission is framed less as “Deal with the threat on ZDR like the badass bounty hunter you are” and more “Just stay alive and make it back to your ship so we can get the hell out of here.” It’s a narrative setup that sets the right tone: You don’t have the upper hand here, not by a longshot. In fact, you’re in peril.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"5cd6c258dd9948f40337c54678a3b836\" data-recommend-id=\"image://5cd6c258dd9948f40337c54678a3b836\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A damaged E.M.M.I., with Samus\' blaster arm pointed at it in the foreground.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"5cd6c258dd9948f40337c54678a3b836\" data-recommend-id=\"image://5cd6c258dd9948f40337c54678a3b836\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A damaged E.M.M.I., with Samus\' blaster arm pointed at it in the foreground.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">That setup wouldn’t have much weight, though, if the gameplay didn’t back it up. It does, as relentlessly and remorselessly as the E.M.M.I. themselves, which have been transformed by some corrupting force into Terminators who will stop at nothing to capture Samus. Scattered across ZDR, the seven robots each patrol their own zone, and when Samus enters their turf, the tense game of cat and mouse begins. Your weapons are powerless to stop them. They hunt you with speed and agility and cold precision, their movements simultaneously graceful and unsettling. If caught, you have one chance to perform a counter that stuns the robot and enables you to escape, but it’s very tough to get the timing right. Fail the counter, and it’s game over. Thankfully, when you’re captured (and you will be, many times), the game shows some mercy and puts you right outside the door to the E.M.M.I. zone so you can give it another shot.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This could have been a recipe for tiresome, trial-and-error gameplay, but in <em>Dread</em>, it never becomes that. The E.M.M.I. feel alive and varied enough in their responses to your behavior that eluding them isn’t just a simple case of gaming the AI, and usually, when I was caught, I could see where I’d gone wrong, how I’d let myself be cornered rather than using the environment and my powers, such as a temporary cloaking ability, to my advantage. Because the E.M.M.I. are such formidable foes, the doors into their zones always filled me with a feeling of dr...let’s say apprehension...and I sometimes took a deep breath or two before venturing in to face them.</p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"80f78b2ba2e1f4dfd6711a3ce797c695\" data-recommend-id=\"image://80f78b2ba2e1f4dfd6711a3ce797c695\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Samus runs to the left through an earthy interior with plant life in the background and a pool of water above.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"80f78b2ba2e1f4dfd6711a3ce797c695\" data-recommend-id=\"image://80f78b2ba2e1f4dfd6711a3ce797c695\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Samus runs to the left through an earthy interior with plant life in the background and a pool of water above.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The game’s not all running for your life, however. You are still Samus Aran, the greatest bounty hunter the galaxy has ever seen, and naturally, you eventually turn the tables on each E.M.M.I. First, you must find and defeat a living computer (called a central unit) in each of their zones. These giant brains with eyeballs are a nice bit of worldbuilding, clearly part of the same lineage that gave birth to series villain Mother Brain, though the connection, refreshingly, is never explicitly spelled out.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Harvesting the power of the defeated central units, you temporarily gain a blast so powerful, even the E.M.M.I. are vulnerable to it. Even then, however, defeating them remains a tense affair. You can only charge and fire these blasts while stationary, so you have to create space between you and your quarry and blast away at them while they approach you, praying that you’ve given yourself enough room to finish the job before they close the distance and end you once again. I exhaled with relief every time I finally shut one down, knowing that I could now move through that area in relative safety.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It is <em>relative </em>safety, though, as the E.M.M.I. are hardly the only threat you face in <em>Dread</em>. Even the ordinary enemies patrolling the caves and tunnels pack a wallop. If you don’t keep an eye on your health, it’s easy to find yourself dying to an attack from some run-of-the-mill jobber. To keep your health up, you’re incentivized to defeat enemies by landing melee counters right when they attack and then blast them to bits, which causes them to give up far more health and missiles than they would otherwise. It’s clearly an effort to keep you more engaged in combat with regular enemies, but after years of games prompting me to counter enemy attacks right when I see a bright flash, I no longer find it very interesting. On the contrary, it made dealing with these foes feel like a rote, Pavlovian process: see flash, hit button, get reward.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Yet bosses are genuinely involving. You have to play carefully, learning their cues and avoiding their attacks, lest they make short work of you. Gone are the days when you could tank a boss with missile spam and a few energy tanks, killing them faster than they could kill you. Here, each extra tank lets you take just one or two more hits before death. <em>Dread</em>’s bosses are strict teachers: You learn or you die. This meant that, by the time I did learn a boss’ attacks well enough to win, I often did so near flawlessly, which was always a satisfying outcome after repeatedly getting destroyed.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The exacting demand of <em>Dread</em>’s boss battles sometimes goes too far, however. One particular late-game fight pits you against a multi-phase boss, and eventually I’d mastered the first two phases well enough to complete them every time but still struggled with the third. Every time I died, I had to spend minutes going through the motions of the first two phases again, just to get another shot at the nasty final form. After one too many cycles of that, I was tempted to smash my fancy OLED Switch to bits.</p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Metroid Dread\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"metroid-dread\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In some ways, being Samus Aran has never felt better. She moves with a speed and agility that are remarkable even by series standards, possesses a new slide that feels like a natural part of her moveset, and gains all the traditional powers that make conquering the best <em>Metroid </em>games so satisfying. Upgrades like the gravity suit, which lets you move through water as if it’s air, and the space jump, which lets you jump not just twice or three times but endlessly, are still so liberating, they almost feel like cheating. And yet, despite delivering all this tried-and-true satisfaction, <em>Dread </em>doesn’t rank as one of the most memorable games in the series.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">That’s because the best <em>Metroid</em> games earn a lasting place in our memory not just by virtue of the joys of being Samus and gradually becoming more powerful, but through excellence in atmosphere, music, and an elegantly minimal approach to narrative. <em>Dread</em>’s visuals are by far the most advanced of any game in the series, and there is indeed something impressive about the way the camera sometimes seamlessly swoops in to show off just how good Samus looks up close. But there’s also something a bit sterile about the look of this game. <em>Super Metroid</em>’s environments have a <em>mood</em>. You feel something in the dim blue lighting of the space station, the eerie stillness of the wrecked ship. <em>Dread</em>’s environments, for all their clean lines and hard edges, never pull you in the way those do.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Dread</em>’s music is similarly lacking something. It lingers in the background, commenting on the action but not really calling attention to itself. I think 2D <em>Metroid </em>games call for music you remember as part of the experience; sparse melodies that capture Samus’ isolation, and robust anthems that celebrate her intrepid heroism.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"6c0c0d8e36a9945486227ee45a6fcc30\" data-recommend-id=\"image://6c0c0d8e36a9945486227ee45a6fcc30\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Samus stands, head slightly bowed, her visor glowing a bright green.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"6c0c0d8e36a9945486227ee45a6fcc30\" data-recommend-id=\"image://6c0c0d8e36a9945486227ee45a6fcc30\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Samus stands, head slightly bowed, her visor glowing a bright green.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">And then, there’s the story. <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://metroid.nintendo.com/news/metroid-dread-report-vol-1/\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://metroid.nintendo.com/news/metroid-dread-report-vol-1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">According to Nintendo</a></span>, <em>Dread “</em>marks the end of the story arc focusing on the strange, interconnected fates of Samus Aran and the Metroids.” I’ve been playing these games from the beginning of that saga, and I am underwhelmed by this conclusion. Without going into specific detail, it offers up a villain who feels out of left field, and who delivers a clunky lore dump of a monologue in a series best served by mystery and narrative simplicity. Samus does undergo some shifts toward the end of the game that feel exactly right, inevitable even, as the series hurtles toward its culmination, but that evolution of Samus as a character deserved a subtler, better story.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">So here we are. Supposedly, the saga is complete, and I’m left with mixed feelings. I’m glad that <em>Dread </em>really goes for it, that it wants to make you feel hunted and disadvantaged and that it’s willing to feel hostile in order to accomplish that. The result is a feeling that survival itself is a reward more meaningful than all the upgrades in the world, a feeling I rarely get from games anymore. But ZDR never captivated me the way previous <em>Metroid </em>settings have, and as a conclusion to the story arc, <em>Dread </em>seems to misunderstand what made the early chapters resonate. Samus is wonderful, a survivor, an icon, and she endures. But when I think back on my time with her over the past several decades, <em>Dread </em>will forever dwell in the shadows of my favorite <em>Metroid </em>memories.</p>', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', 'Metroid Dread: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/9a3240496ae4089804a3c916f0080c79.jpg', 'switch', 'https://kotaku.com/metroid-dread-the-kotaku-review-1847823602', 'I admit I was skeptical.

Your grandmother is picking up a movie and she has no idea what it is yet, so you have time. There is a room with several hundred video games. You have a used Xbox 360, filled with the half-remembered save files of its previous owner, and a PS2 without a memory card. You pick a game called <em>Dark Souls</em>, for the Xbox 360, which your grandmother side-eyes, because while she doesn’t go to church, she does use angel cards to speak with Gabriel. You assuage her fears by reminding her that she really liked the movie <em>Hobo with a Shotgun</em>, so does she really have any room to talk?</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You go home and load a mid-game save (thanks, previous Xbox owner) only to be killed by snakes and rolling boulders. You are in Sen’s Fortress and you are 12 and confused. The process repeats the next day with a new game.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This is what playing <em>WarioWare: Get It Together!</em> feels like. You are always 12 and you are always confused. If you can condense this sensation into a seven-second blast of stimuli, then you can imagine <em>WarioWare: Get It Together!</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/warioware-gold-the-kotaku-review-1828062269\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/warioware-gold-the-kotaku-review-1828062269\">The <em>WarioWare </em>series</a></span> has quietly cemented itself as one of Nintendo’s <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/the-unusual-effort-that-went-into-creating-warioware-go-1829840289\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/the-unusual-effort-that-went-into-creating-warioware-go-1829840289\">oddest franchises</a></span>, which is saying something for Nintendo, the company that got everyone to buy <em>Brain Age</em> like, a few times. <em>WarioWare</em> is built on <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/warioware-style-game-is-a-masterclass-in-fun-horror-1847583734\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/warioware-style-game-is-a-masterclass-in-fun-horror-1847583734\">microgames</a></span>, sub-15-second video games with incredibly simple instructions, controls, and no tutorials. They are an onslaught for the senses, constantly presenting you with new objectives and ways of interacting with the game. Sometimes you’re drawing, sometimes you’re a little guy, sometimes you just mash a button. You never know what’s going to hit you next, which is why people love them.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"fdb86ce7e69b5f6cd4e156c6eb4ee53b\" data-recommend-id=\"image://fdb86ce7e69b5f6cd4e156c6eb4ee53b\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\'A child holds a plate with a piece of candy surrounded by grey cubes.

You are always some variant of little guy in <em>WarioWare: Get It Together!</em> You will never be a pencil or a pair of scissors, just a cute lil dude trying to get things done. This could, at first, feel limiting for a series built around giving you wild control schemes, but the game makes it work by giving you around two dozen tiny friends, each of whom control differently from one another. Additionally, a lot of microgames have a different layout depending on your character. If you try to escape a building as 18-Volt, a character who can throw discs but can’t walk, the level will be populated with rings for you to grab onto, which means it plays very differently than it would for Cricket, the kid who can jump.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Characters are definitely built to be better at some games than others, as certain control schemes become wildly unwieldy in a lot of scenarios. However, there is a joy to this unwieldiness. Being handed a character whose abilities are a bad fit for the microgame at hand leads to a lot of dumb fun. Trying to turn a windmill as a character who can’t stop jumping is awkward! And that awkwardness is the point. The <em>WarioWare</em> games are a love letter to the medium, indulging in all the silliness it has to offer.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The thing I love about <em>Get It Together! </em>in particular is that it models the experience of learning games for the first time. As someone who has been doing this for too long, most of gaming’s verbs are familiar to me. I know that right moves you right and left moves you left. I’ve built the muscle memory necessary to play first-person shooters on both mouse and keyboard and controller. I’ve developed enough game literacy that most mechanics are intuited and internalized almost instantly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"\"><span class=\"clear-both flex-video video-315 widescreen\"><iframe data-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ir6oK58mXYM\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-forms\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitAllowFullScreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" class=\"lazyload\" scrolling=\"yes\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">By applying a bunch of different control schemes to the same objectives, <em>WarioWare: Get It Together! </em>let’s me relive the joy of learning how to move in a video game. I don’t have to relearn how to play every new action RPG once I’ve developed the prerequisite skillset, once I’ve learned <em>how</em> to learn. <em>WarioWare’s</em> microgames barely give you time to figure out your objectives, let alone what you’re doing with your hands. However, you still develop that literacy over time, which is a great feeling!<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I know how to move Ashley through a space, and how her abilities work. As I apply her skillset to more and more situations, I get better at understanding the design of both the games I’m using her for, and the character herself. Even when I don’t like how a particular character controls, the process of learning them is a fun exercise. And the variety allows me to better articulate what I like and why. I enjoy characters who can move in any direction. I enjoy characters with strange control schemes that allow them to do wacky stuff. I don’t like characters that auto-jump.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Playing <em>WarioWare</em> reminds me how, and why, I became a critic. It was by playing hundreds of games for two hours each, regardless of tone or genre. My grandmother, and her parallel love of movies, let me touch an entire Family Video’s worth of weird and messy art. My colleague John Walker recently asked if there’s any kind of video game I don’t play, and I told him no, there isn’t. Games I don’t like are still interesting, and still worth my time and energy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>WarioWare: Get It Together!</em> is all of my messy love for this stupid art form distilled into one totally solid microgame collection that would make a great party game, and I am grateful for the few hours I have spent with it.</p>', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', 'WarioWare: Get It Together!: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/6a18be9dd059ea3a2a35e20def55fa85.jpg', 'switch', 'https://kotaku.com/warioware-get-it-together-the-kotaku-review-1847652481', ' You are 12 years old and you are in the local Family Video.

It’s actually a rather cozy gig. You’re given a place to stay, top-of-the-line camera equipment, and an unlimited supply of fluffruit to throw at Pokémon to get their attention. You’re also given unlimited access to the NEO-ONE, a high-tech vehicle capable of teleportation and able to survive in the harshest of environments. You aren’t allowed to steer the NEO-ONE, only ride in it as it patrols set paths, giving every course in the game an amusement park ride feel. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"oobniunuac0qtna5s7ng\" data-recommend-id=\"image://oobniunuac0qtna5s7ng\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"oobniunuac0qtna5s7ng\" data-recommend-id=\"image://oobniunuac0qtna5s7ng\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Though developed by Bandai Namco Games, <em>New Pokémon Snap</em> is a Nintendo-published game, and early access to Nintendo games means there’s certain information I will not be able to impart over the course of this review. I can’t reveal the exact number of Pokémon in the game, the number of islands in the Lental region, or the number of photo-shooting courses and their variants. There are certain creatures I cannot mention, and aspects of the game’s story Nintendo would rather we keep under wraps until the game officially launches this Friday.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I understand the restrictions. As much as I would love to tell you... certain things about the game, it’ll be much more exciting for you to discover these things on your own. That, or wait until after the weekend when everyone runs their guides on how to get the best pictures of Whosiwhatsit in the secret underground cave that may or may not exist. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"od8duwwojznyy5amaz3r\" data-recommend-id=\"image://od8duwwojznyy5amaz3r\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"od8duwwojznyy5amaz3r\" data-recommend-id=\"image://od8duwwojznyy5amaz3r\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I can tell you that taking pictures of Pokémon is still a damn fine way to spend an evening. More than 200 pocket monsters are waiting to be captured on film in <em>New Pokémon Snap</em>, spread across several colorful and varied biomes. Initially, you’re a passenger, a passive NEO-ONE rider who can only snap pictures until the ride comes to a complete stop. But soon you gain special tools that allow you to interact with the region’s fauna. Toss a fluffruit at a Pokémon to catch it eating a snack or shake it out of hiding. Play music to make Pokémon dance or sing. New to the series are Illumina Orbs, glowing spheres native to region that illicit all sorts of strange and magical responses from pocket monsters.<br></p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"New Pokémon Snap\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"new-pok-mon-snap\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Each ride in the NEO-ONE is a chance to uncover new Pokémon and hidden secrets, sort of like the action version of a hidden object game. The environments are filled to the brim with little details, layers upon layers of foliage thick with life. Depending on the tools you use and where your camera is pointed you can discover ancient ruins, explore alternate paths, and capture the coolest pictures of Pokémon possible. </p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"nfmi2pslrhefvcu5dkbe\" data-recommend-id=\"image://nfmi2pslrhefvcu5dkbe\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"nfmi2pslrhefvcu5dkbe\" data-recommend-id=\"image://nfmi2pslrhefvcu5dkbe\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Pictures like this stunning shot of Florges, captured by yours truly during a daytime run through the Florio Nature Park.  It could use some more pocket monsters, but the size is excellent. Florges is well-framed and looking directly at the camera. According to Professor Mirror’s grading system, the picture is worth 4,543 points. Those points are added to my Research Level for Florio Nature Park. Unlocking higher Research Levels changes up a course, adding new monsters and even more secrets to discover. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Note  that my Florges picture is rated three stars. Filling out your Lental Photodex isn’t just about grabbing the best shot. There are four star levels for each Pokémon, and each star level is rated bronze, silver, gold, or platinum. A shot from far off with the subject looking away from the camera might rate a single star, while capturing a critter in a perfectly centered rare pose earns four stars. While the urge to get the best possible photo is strong, sometimes you need to curb your virtual photography skills to grab something lower quality. The mechanic is a little counterintuitive, but it does wonders for replayability. </p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"psewzytbn59kwt393reh\" data-recommend-id=\"image://psewzytbn59kwt393reh\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"psewzytbn59kwt393reh\" data-recommend-id=\"image://psewzytbn59kwt393reh\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">And this is <em>New Pokémon Snap</em>, so the photo fun doesn’t stop when the NEO-ONE ride is over. You can fiddle around with your captured snaps in several nifty ways. For example, once a course is over and your pictures have been graded, you’re given the option to re-snap pictures, adjusting focus and filters to make your pic the very best, like no one photograph ever was. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Also, you can do this. </p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"sc3doaaohqnm7thhjy7s\" data-recommend-id=\"image://sc3doaaohqnm7thhjy7s\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"sc3doaaohqnm7thhjy7s\" data-recommend-id=\"image://sc3doaaohqnm7thhjy7s\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Back in 1999 on the Nintendo 64, if we wanted to share <em>Pokémon Snap</em> photos we had to invited people over (gross) or have our cartridges stolen by ex-girlfriends (true story). Now we have the internet, which we can fill with be-stickered pictures of Pokémon until the cloud runs out of space, which will never happen because clouds are magical. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>New Pokémon Snap</em> is pretty magical as well. It takes the unique formula of the 1999 original and expands on it just enough to feel like a completely new adventure, without diluting the simple joy of riding and snapping photos of impossible creatures. </p>', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', 'New Pokémon Snap: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/znnlmmtujlgxdi8bgnar.jpg', 'switch', 'https://kotaku.com/new-pokemon-snap-the-kotaku-review-1846779223', 'After 21 years, gaming’s least violent on-rails shooter triumphantly returns to ...', '');

Like most open-world adventures, everything is designed to get you to explore what’s over the next hill or across that nearby river. The map is peppered with question marks, many of which surround towns and temples in which you meet allies and upgrade equipment. Helpful diversions like hot springs and fox dens have obvious environmental tells. The wind, a major contributor to the game’s overall aesthetic, literally guides you to objectives. But there’s a big difference between scouring a map to completion and actually having a good time, no matter how obsessive a person you may be.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">The story opens with Japan on the brink of war. A small group of samurai have gathered on a Tsushima beachhead to repel an invading Mongol force led by Khotun Khan, a fictional descendant of Genghis and Kublai Khan. While the Mongols attacked Japan on multiple occasions, <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> liberally combines various historical and cultural artifacts for an entirely new narrative. As was the case in the late 13th century, the samurai find themselves unprepared to deal with the invaders’ overwhelming military tactics and get almost completely annihilated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> puts you in control of Jin Sakai, one of the island’s last remaining samurai. A half-dead Jin is pulled from the battlefield by a wandering thief named Yuna, only to rush off in an attempt to free his captured uncle. Jin makes it his mission to save his home from the invaders, who have wasted no time in running roughshod over Tsushima as a prelude to their attack on the Japanese mainland. For the player, this translates to random battles throughout the countryside and liberating villages occupied by the Mongols, sometimes with Jin’s allies but mostly on your own.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"jspd5uzi8cqcupkvm1vj\" data-recommend-id=\"image://jspd5uzi8cqcupkvm1vj\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2890\" data-height=\"1626\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"jspd5uzi8cqcupkvm1vj\" data-recommend-id=\"image://jspd5uzi8cqcupkvm1vj\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2890\" data-height=\"1626\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Jin is a blank slate in the early hours of <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, with only brief flashbacks to his time learning from his uncle as any indication of who he is under his gruff exterior. As an idealized image of the samurai warrior caste that existed in Japan at the time, he spends a lot of time worrying about the dichotomy of honor and shame. But it soon becomes abundantly clear that Jin must adopt new tactics, even those he views as “dishonorable,” to liberate Tsushima, adding a thin layer of internal strife to the more overt conflict against the Mongols.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">This aspect of <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> gave me pause when developer Sucker Punch Productions showed off early previews. Samurai have been extensively mythologized in modern times, reimagining what was essentially the paramilitary arm of a system of feudal land ownership as noble, superhuman dispensers of justice. Before playing the game, I imagined this stereotypical concept would tie into some weird, <em>Mass Effect</em>-esque morality system by which the main character would vacillate between “honor” and “shame” depending on how he approached every situation.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Thankfully, that’s not the case, even if the game’s narrative tunnel-visions on the concept. There’s no penalty for approaching battles in <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> stealthily, which Jin considers a violation of samurai code. You don’t get locked out of any skill trees or storylines depending on how you decide to fight. While Jin is forced to take a more stealthy approach for both tutorial and narrative reasons early on, there’s also nothing stopping you from proudly walking into an enemy encampment and challenging dozens of Mongols to a straight-up fight. Sure, the best approach will always be a mixture of traditional katana skills and more “underhanded” tools like smoke bombs and firecrackers, but the game never punishes you for living out your own personal version of <em>Seven Samurai</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">That enduring image of a lone warrior surrounded by foes becomes a neat gameplay mechanic in <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>. When approaching a group of enemies, Jin can call out to them with a challenge for one-on-one combat against their strongest fighter. Here, the game asks you to hold the Triangle button and keep a close eye on your opponent. When they make a move, that’s your cue to release the button, which causes Jin to unsheathe his sword and unleash a deadly, one-hit kill. By the end of the game, a combination of skills and armor made it so I could slice through five enemies in a row before actually starting a battle, which proved to be a boon for some of the more difficult dust-ups.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"bq519zrzw8m0jnae3zrl\" data-recommend-id=\"image://bq519zrzw8m0jnae3zrl\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"bq519zrzw8m0jnae3zrl\" data-recommend-id=\"image://bq519zrzw8m0jnae3zrl\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>’s swordplay is basic and engaging, a mixture of light and heavy attacks, parries, and dodges, tied to specific buttons or button combos. The combat system is very easy to grasp if you’ve played any recent video game, perhaps as a way to indicate, through gameplay, that Jin has been learning to fight with a katana since he was a child. As the game goes on, you learn various stances—combat styles that you can shift into at will—by observing and killing Mongol generals. Stances are meant to deal with different types of enemies: The stone stance, for instance, is better suited to taking down swordsmen, whereas the water stance’s flow of bludgeoning strikes is perfect for decimating shields. These stances, much like the rest of Jin’s repertoire, can be improved with skill points earned from defeating enemies and completing missions to unlock more combo strings and increase damage.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">The “ghost” in <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> refers to Jin’s transformation from a rigid samurai warrior into a guerrilla vigilante willing to do anything to save his home. Where a samurai might focus entirely on his katana and bow, the covert tactics Jin learns over the course of the campaign give him access to a multitude of more subtle weaponry. This starts out with some basic kunai, which can be thrown to break an opponent’s guard from a distance, but quickly expands to include tools like smoke bombs, explosives, and even wind chimes that draw enemies’ attention. Jin’s most important tool, however, is his tanto, a short blade that allows him to perform quick, violent assassinations from the shadows. It’s rare to enter a fight where you’re not vastly outnumbered, so it’s best to balance the scales as much as possible from the relative comfort of stealth. The only time where stealth really feels required is when the Mongols have taken hostages. If an enemy spots you, they’ll start to cut down prisoners unless you can stop them.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">These two aspects of Jin’s arsenal combine to make every battle in <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> fluid, evolving affairs. While you might initially sneak into a Mongol encampment, one wrong move can turn the mission into an all-out brawl against the camp’s entire garrison. I usually found myself picking off high-priority targets like bruisers with medieval shotguns and explosive-throwing support troops with my bow before wading into battle, where smart usage of my stances were key to surviving. Eventually, the Mongols begin to employ the services of animals like hunting dogs and hawks, which can sniff you out or spot you from above. I never found myself tiring of the basic flow of combat, but I quickly got so strong that stealthy approaches were just a waste of time when there weren’t any hostages to protect. Why assassinate Mongols when I could just walk up, challenge them to a duel, and mop up the stragglers?</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Besides combat, much of the game is dedicated to exploring the island’s lush environments. Jin strides across vast fields of flowers, the muck and mire of swamplands, and even the icy northern reaches of Tsushima during his adventure. At one point, he dropped his hand to feel the foliage as I raced along on a horse, mimicking my exact desire in that moment. <em>Tsushima</em> also features a weather system that, while not offering much apart from rain storms and rolling fog, gives the beautiful scenery an additional coat of aesthetic flair. Over the course of the game, Jin can learn songs on his flute that change the weather at will, which doesn’t really mean anything mechanically but makes for a fun way to customize your experience.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> has an almost insatiable desire to remind you of its influences through its visuals. Each mission opens with a title card that draws inspiration from old samurai films. An optional black-and-white visual filter is literally named after legendary director Akira Kurosawa but imparts the game with none of the charm or humanity for which his films are known. Important duels are preceded by a lengthy, tension-building cutscene that ultimately functioned as a minute or so to check my phone while waiting for it to play out for the tenth time. Every attempt at infusing <em>Tsushima</em> with these cribbed details feels like a wink and a nudge for recognition rather than true homage.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> fills its expanses with multiple diversions. Tall, white flags indicate the presence of a bamboo strike mini-game, which asks you to quickly tap out increasingly difficult button sequences to increase Jin’s resolve meter. In combat, this meter allows you to heal, use special techniques like a series of devastating slashes that homes in on opponents, and even revive yourself. Hot springs can be found beneath trees with orange blossoms, giving Jin a chance to decompress and extending his health bar. Swarms of fireflies mean a fox den is nearby, the denizen of which will lead you to a special shrine that lets you carry more charms, accessories with bonuses that range from simple stat boosts to more interesting mechanics like regaining arrows on a headshot. While it’s fun to listen to Jin’s internal thoughts while at the hot spring and to pet the foxes after their guidance, I never found myself excited to see one of these landmarks on the horizon. They were merely there to complete for a reward, a far cry from the dynamic intensity of battle.</p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Ghost of Tsushima\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"ghost-of-tsushima\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Most of <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>’s activities exist simply to reward you rather than offer any meaningful experience. The layer of Japanese aesthetics barely hides the fact that the world is just there to be mindlessly mined for resources. It feels very weird to save a peasant from a group of Mongol soldiers, only to have them turn around and reward Jin with whatever meager possessions they were able to hide away. The game also has no problem with allowing you to raid homesteads for materials like iron and leather, which can then be used to upgrade your gear. Jin is the head of his clan, an aristocratic warrior who never wanted for anything in his life. Why is he so eager to squeeze every last resource from the people he’s supposed to be protecting? Life was hard before the Mongols arrived, and now villages and farms are burning. Those supplies would be much more useful in attending to refugees rather than a man whose sole ambition is reinstating the power structure that enforced these hardships in the first place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Jin isn’t sympathetic or interesting enough to care about. Any growth he shows over the course of the game deals entirely with his approach to warfare, rather than the imbalances within the society he seeks to protect or even his own responsibility for maintaining them. When a friend from his childhood betrays him, for instance, Jin does very little personal inventory about how he might have contributed to the turncoat’s view of the world, instead focusing on a quest for revenge that could have been entirely prevented with a little bit of compassion.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">The story’s saving grace involves the multi-part side missions that focus on Jin’s allies. Many of these missions follow a similar pattern that usually ends with just another battle, but the characters Jin recruits are so compelling and charming that it makes up for any predictable gameplay decisions. In one mission, Jin finds himself assisting an aging warrior named Lady Masako in finding the people who conspired to murder her entire family amidst the Mongol invasion. Her quest for revenge forces Jin to come to grips with his own anger, and at one point they even come to blows when he stops her from carrying out an arguably more justified form of the revenge he himself seeks against Khotun Khan. Another side mission sees Jin meeting an old archery mentor, Sensei Ishikawa, to help him find his star pupil. Ishikawa’s relationship with his student mirrors Jin’s own relationship with his uncle, giving Jin an outside perspective on his struggle between the honor taught to him by his family and what must be done to defeat the invaders.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"ianjefo5rrcludku4da1\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ianjefo5rrcludku4da1\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"ianjefo5rrcludku4da1\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ianjefo5rrcludku4da1\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Despite (or perhaps because of) <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>’s reliance on combat to drive many of its set pieces, the game’s best mission requires almost no combat. At various points in the game, Jin learns of local legends that lead to great rewards, like a robe that improves your archery skills or the ability to light your katana on fire. The latter requires climbing a massive mountain, atop which supposedly sits a meteor with the ability to imbue blades with flames. While this would be dangerous in and of itself, a snowstorm threatens to freeze Jin before he makes it to the summit. The mission, then, revolves around navigating treacherous mountain paths while making sure to find sporadic campfires before Jin succumbs to the cold. The climbing mechanics are so barebones that they barely warrant a mention elsewhere, but in the swirling vortex of the blizzard, learning how to spot footholds and places to attach Jin’s grappling hook become vital. I won’t ruin what you find at the top, but the journey was enough to make the quest for a burning blade one of my favorite parts of <em>Tsushima</em>. I just wish the game offered more of these moments.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> is pretty as heck—sporadic capturing left me with almost 50 GB worth of screenshots and short video clips to sift through—but at its core, it’s just another open-world game. I found myself audibly sighing every time I crested a hill towards a mystery objective only to find another fox to follow or another haiku to compose. These diversions, while unique at first glance, proved to just be busy work as time wore on. I was so strong by the end of the game—filling up every skill tree is easy if you ignore the main story and just explore for a bit—that I didn’t even bother using stealth tactics for the last third. I don’t think I even died after the first few hours. There’s so little to get excited about in <em>Tsushima</em> once the initial wonder of the wind physics and lush environments wears off that the only thing that kept me going was my own innate desire to fill out the entire map. And that can only hold someone’s interest for so long.</p>', '2024-01-10 17:12:01', '2024-01-10 17:12:01', 'Ghost Of Tsushima: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/qaoejn0mhxyankd2kbvb.jpg', 'ps4', 'https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-tsushima-the-kotaku-review-1844368841', 'Ghost of Tsushima is a game of compulsion.

In the movies, Tony Stark’s advanced armor operates like VR, with a virtual screen projected inside his helmet. So when I put on my PSVR headset and started playing <em>Iron Man VR</em> I felt like that famous, armor-wearing superhero. Unfortunately, I didn’t have to just contend with super-villains. Technical problems ended up ruining much of my excitement and enjoyment. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Iron Man VR</em> is, as the name implies, a virtual reality game that is built for the PSVR headset and motion controllers. In it, you play as Tony Stark, the famous billionaire who once ran a weapons company, but became a crime-fighting superhero who wears a powerful mech suit. <em>Iron Man VR</em> isn’t set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but is heavily inspired by those films. Tony Stark in both the game and the MCU has a large ego, is quick to spit out a joke and seems to be hiding a lot of guilt over his weapon selling past. His home in the game has a near-identical layout to the MCU version of Stark’s Malibu mansion. Even his suit not only looks like the MCU Iron man suit, but has the same sound effects and abilities. This is good. It helped me get lost in the world more, as it is a world I’m very familiar with.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The setup for this Iron Man tale is the sudden appearance of the teleporting villain Ghost, who begins causing havoc in Tony’s life. So Stark reactivates The Gunsmith, a dangerous AI built before he was a superhero, to help him fight back. Gunsmith is a super-advanced weapon-building and combat-training AI that uses a Tony Stark hologram as its avatar. While Gunsmith is effective and helpful, his brash and dangerous plans often cause more headaches and problems for Tony and his more peaceful suit-based AI, Friday. The family dynamics among the three are the core of the story.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"hf4lmufhkwimav4wl9k0\" data-recommend-id=\"image://hf4lmufhkwimav4wl9k0\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"hf4lmufhkwimav4wl9k0\" data-recommend-id=\"image://hf4lmufhkwimav4wl9k0\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Iron Man VR’</em>s world and characters are its strongest and most consistently good elements. The interactions between these various characters are my favorite moments. They joke around, they tease each other, they get on each other’s nerves and they bicker or fight. The writing is sharp and often genuinely funny or interesting. I cared about these characters and what was going to happen to them. Even the villains become sympathetic characters who get more fleshed out by the end of the game. There are still some dumb video game moments, like the boss fight at the very end and a few plot points that made me roll my eyes with how obvious and silly they were, but by and large, playing <em>Iron Man VR</em> felt like being part of an MCU film. A B-tier MCU film, like a <em>Thor </em>or an <em>Antman</em>, but still a solid and fun superhero adventure.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Great character dynamics and solid writing aren’t why folks are going to play <em>Iron Man VR</em>. People want to <em>be </em>Iron Man. They want to fly around, blow stuff up and fight supervillains. And this is where <em>Iron Man VR</em>, sadly, falls apart more often than not.<br></p>\n\n\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Iron Man VR\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"iron-man-vr\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Initially, I was impressed. It’s a bit gimmicky, but actually using the PS Motion controllers as Tony’s hand jets makes this feel unlike any other VR flying game I’ve played. To fly forward, you angle your hands behind your back. To stop, you can throw your hands in front of you, just like Iron Man does in the movies, and stop on a dime. It feels good. Turning is a bit less intuitive, as it is set to buttons on either controller, but I got used to it quickly and within a few minutes I was flying around like a pro. This is where I want to warn you that you need to have a strong VR stomach to play <em>Iron Man VR</em>. Whipping about at high speeds, while moving your head to look around— starting and stopping quickly—might cause some to feel motion sick. There are comfort settings you can turn on, like a setting that darkens the screen when you spin around fast, but this is still a fairly advanced VR game. I played with all of the comfort settings off and felt fine, but for less experienced or more sensitive VR players, be careful.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You don’t just fly in <em>Iron Man VR</em>, there’s also a bunch of combat. In theory, the combat controls seem smart. You hold your palms up to fire Iron Man’s famous laser blasts, and you point your wrist down to fire wrist-mounted auxiliary weapons, like grenades or missiles. You can also rocket punch enemies by holding a button and then punching. This may sound fine, but, in practice, it’s a bit of a mess.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"rt72iwagp7zwpfsg3a7y\" data-recommend-id=\"image://rt72iwagp7zwpfsg3a7y\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"rt72iwagp7zwpfsg3a7y\" data-recommend-id=\"image://rt72iwagp7zwpfsg3a7y\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">There are a few major issues. For starters, the PSVR tracking doesn’t feel precise enough to always detect some of the motions needed during combat. Often I would try to shoot people with my missiles, but end up shooting lasers instead, or vice versa. Another problem is that some of the motions needed for combat aren’t comfortable. For example, flipping your wrist down to fire a missile feels cool, but then you have to arch your arm and wrist back up slightly so the PS Move controller can actually aim at your target. It doesn’t work well and it quickly hurt my wrists. Punches don’t always register, and button presses sometimes felt delayed, adding to an overall sense of inconsistency and frustration during combat.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">However, I might have been able to ignore a lot of these problems if the game ran better during large combat sequences. Instead, the biggest problem <em>Iron Man VR</em> suffers from is poor performance. In a standard TV game, this isn’t always a deal-breaker. In a VR game, it is a huge problem. As I said before, I’m highly experienced with VR and have a strong stomach for all of the issues that can pop up, including huge FPS drops. And I’m thankful for that because I can easily see folks who aren’t as experienced getting headaches or becoming motion sick from the performance drops. I’m not talking about a few missed frames, but instead moments where the game almost becomes a slideshow. I played <em>Iron Man VR</em> on a PS4 Pro and still encountered these issues. It made the already finicky combat even more of a pain to deal with as I wasn’t just dealing with poor controls, but also annoying performance problems too.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">And making all of this worse is just how much combat is in this game. You spend at least 75% of the game’s approximately eight hours of runtime fighting near-endless waves of drones and robots. The middle section <em>Iron Man VR</em> is a slog, filled with multiple levels where you fly into an area, get some story, and then fight a bunch of robots for 15 minutes. What’s frustrating is that the start and end of this game are so much stronger and more interesting than the slog of combat you deal with in the middle.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"eeftcwk7gpxc4ys9mnwh\" data-recommend-id=\"image://eeftcwk7gpxc4ys9mnwh\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"eeftcwk7gpxc4ys9mnwh\" data-recommend-id=\"image://eeftcwk7gpxc4ys9mnwh\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The beginning is filled with great character moments, a cool sequence with a plane (which is in the demo), and some simple, but cute “learning to fly” moments. The end section is also creative and different, forcing the player and Tony to figure out different ways to keep their suit powered up while trapped in a dark cave, being hunted the whole time. Instead of feeling all-powerful, you feel trapped in your suit as you desperately try to survive. These sections of the game make me wish I got something half as long, but with more of these types of sequences. Instead, <em>Iron Man VR </em>feels padded with endless combat and weapons in an attempt to make it feel more like a big, fully-featured video game.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Iron Man VR</em> would have been better off being smaller, focusing the game on telling a story and using the suit in interesting and fresh ways. Instead, it focuses on being a big combat simulator that’s too clumsy to enjoy. Strong voice acting and writing can’t overcome all of <em>Iron Man VR</em>’s technical problems, which are bad enough that I would warn most players who haven’t tried much VR to stay away. For those with strong VR stomachs and a love of the MCU, there’s enough here that you might have a good time. But you might be better off just downloading the demo instead. <br></p>', '2024-01-10 17:12:01', '2024-01-10 17:12:01', 'Iron Man VR: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/ffotskew3c9930qa2cm3.jpg', 'ps4', 'https://kotaku.com/iron-man-vr-the-kotaku-review-1844238508', 'Iron Man feels like a perfect fit for virtual reality.

Every weapon reload, killing blow, and crafted item takes time and button presses. At times the game is painfully slow; even in the most action-packed sections you put in effort to move things forward. You’re paid for this work in a grim story and explicit violence. It can be exciting and beautiful, but mostly I just felt like shit.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong><em>This piece originally appeared 6/12/20. We’ve bumped it today for the game’s US release.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>The Last of Us 2</em>, out June 19 for PlayStation 4, is a sequel to Naughty Dog’s dark 2013 sort-of-zombie adventure <em>The Last of Us. </em>It’s a third-person game where your character is trying to exact revenge, but infected ex-humans and warring militias keep getting in the way. You can deal with these obstacles by sneaking past them, but more likely than not you’ll end up fighting them with limited ammo, improvised weapons like trip mines and pipe bombs, and a thrown brick or two. Its main setting of a post-apocalyptic Seattle is huge and challenging to navigate—when you aren’t fighting, you’re pushing debris out of the way, squeezing through gaps, and crawling under rubble. This gives the game a sense of effort and scale that make traversing a few city blocks feel like a huge adventure, but it’s also exhausting.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">As suggested by interviews with its creators and its own marketing, <em>The Last of Us 2</em> is meant to feel very, very bad. Director Neil Druckmann has touted the game, as he <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRj3B3GY9KM&amp;list=PLol_ykYs3OQ56yDMhIlMYr3XS-QF8JbiX&amp;index=7\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRj3B3GY9KM&amp;list=PLol_ykYs3OQ56yDMhIlMYr3XS-QF8JbiX&amp;index=7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">described</a></span> in one video, as “a commentary about the cycle of violence” and a game that asks “philosophical questions” about revenge and consequences. Pre-release marketing made it clear the game would be a divisively violent, difficult experience. Going in, I wasn’t sure I <em>wanted</em> a game that asked me questions about the consequences of my actions, since I live in the world we all find ourselves in now, where I’m hyper-aware of the fact that a careless cough in the grocery store could kill someone I’ve never met. I knew it would be hard to play, especially now. I knew I probably wouldn’t enjoy it in any traditional sense.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">My playthrough of <em>The Last of Us 2</em> felt terrible to experience. Over the course of my 27 hours with the game, it grew to the point of feeling nearly unbearable. This wasn’t because it asked me hard questions about my own capacity for harm or revenge, or pulled some <em>Spec Ops: The Line</em>-style moralizing about video game violence. Despite Druckmann’s promised “philosophical questions,” I never felt like the game <em>asked</em> me anything. Instead, it told me “brutality,” repeatedly and louder, until by the end I couldn’t hear what it was trying to say at all. Characters make hideous, irredeemable choices, over and over. Everybody suffers, physically and emotionally, in graphic detail. This is all intended to prove a point, but the only point I got from the game was simply to be required to stare at violence, and play through violence, and then do that again, and more, and again, and more.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"lfeckrigcfmwaizfhrum\" data-recommend-id=\"image://lfeckrigcfmwaizfhrum\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"lfeckrigcfmwaizfhrum\" data-recommend-id=\"image://lfeckrigcfmwaizfhrum\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">A lot of this violence is just run-of-the-mill games violence, the kind I honestly don’t spend a lot of my time worrying about. The game’s world has been overtaken by a fungal infection that’s turned most of the population into zombies called Infected. They’re half-monster and half-plant, and they come in varieties that require different strategies. They’re terrifying and beautiful, and you respond to that beauty by knifing them in showers of blood and listening to them writhe and scream when you light them on fire with explosives. You also kill a lot of human enemies, whom the developers have given names and friends, and whose beliefs have led them to join one of two factions: the militant Washington Liberation Front or the religious Seraphites. Despite the factions’ ideological differences, they all die the same when you shotgun them in the face or nail them with an arrow. They cry in fear or call for the friends you’ve either killed or are about to. One faction has scent-tracking dogs—who you’ll also kill—who whine over their dead masters.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You’re supposed to feel bad about this—in his <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/three-hours-with-the-last-of-us-part-ii-1838458838\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/three-hours-with-the-last-of-us-part-ii-1838458838\">preview</a></span> of a section of the game, <em>Kotaku’</em>s reporter Nathan quoted narrative lead Halley Gross (known for her work on HBO’s <em>Westworld</em>) as saying of combat, “So much of what we’re trying to do is create empathy for the other. We make this enemy, and then how do we make you feel for them?” But the game’s story has so much more violence, so much more suffering that plays out over multi-stage quests and long cutscenes and effortful quicktime events, that I lost the ability to care about these everyday acts of carnage or whether I could have avoided them. There was only one combat moment in which I actually felt a moral qualm about killing enemies. I tried to avoid it, but as soon as my stealth attempt failed, I just shot my way through the survivors. This is perhaps a commentary—that it’s easier to inflict harm to get what you want than not—but by that point the game’s violence had worn me down so much that even these characters with names and friends and pets were just more virtual bodies on the pile.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If you’ve read this far into the review looking for more details about just what this game is about, there’s a catch. Even though many of the game’s plot details were unexpectedly leaked via a <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/hackers-are-likely-responsible-for-the-last-of-us-ii-le-1843230805\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/hackers-are-likely-responsible-for-the-last-of-us-ii-le-1843230805\">hack</a></span> in late April, a condition of us being able to review the game a week early with a Sony-provided copy is that we can’t spoil certain things. There’s plenty in the game I wouldn’t have spoiled anyway, since it’s full of events that are meant to surprise. And I can say that, having dug into those leaks, there was plenty in the game that surprised and shocked me. But key parts of the game’s story are off-limits here—not just how the game ends, for example, but also how it begins—as are large portions vital to explaining why I felt how I did about it. People who’ve seen the leaks may know some of this—though not all—but for the purposes of this review, there’s a whole lot to talk around.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The original <em>The Last of Us</em> told a story that felt small and human, whereas the second tells one of all-consuming vengeance. In that first game, a gruff middle-aged smuggler named Joel has to shepherd a 14-year-old girl named Ellie across the post-apocalyptic United States. Ellie is immune to the outbreak, and Joel is taking her to a medical base to see if her immunity can help create a vaccine. In the game’s astonishing ending—<strong>spoilers?</strong>—when Joel learns that making the vaccine will kill Ellie, he murders the doctor and takes her from the hospital. He lies to her about what happened, telling her a cure is impossible. The player is left wondering if Ellie believes him in the game’s last moments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>The Last of Us 2 </em>begins four years after that moment, 25 years into the outbreak. Joel and Ellie, now 19, live in a settlement in Wyoming. They’re estranged from each other, and their interactions are sorrowful and tense. Ellie’s life is grim, but it has safety and goodness too. When the game starts, she’s recently shared a kiss with a woman named Dina, an event Naughty Dog showed in the game’s E3 2018 <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btmN-bWwv0A&amp;list=PLol_ykYs3OQ56yDMhIlMYr3XS-QF8JbiX&amp;index=16\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btmN-bWwv0A&amp;list=PLol_ykYs3OQ56yDMhIlMYr3XS-QF8JbiX&amp;index=16\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gameplay trailer</a></span>.<strong> </strong>In the early hours, players get a glimpse of Ellie and Dina’s lives. They go on patrol for Infected; they smoke a joint; they have sex; they start falling in love.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"ich1wppfly6g3ycn9uq8\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ich1wppfly6g3ycn9uq8\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"ich1wppfly6g3ycn9uq8\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ich1wppfly6g3ycn9uq8\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The characters are diverse, covering a range of genders, sexualities, and ethnicities. The game handles all of this well, neither downplaying it nor drawing undue attention to it. In a masterful scene, Ellie and Dina both share secrets; as a queer player, it felt wonderful to see queer characters confess things other than their sexuality. While I don’t consider representation alone an accomplishment, I appreciated the diverse cast. The game doesn’t make any big statements about it, which feels like the right choice—different kinds of people exist, and they face the game’s world, good and bad, like everyone else.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Despite the things in Ellie’s life that are going well, what happened at the hospital haunts her, and it strains her relationship with Joel. The lie eats at them both, whether they know it’s a lie or not. Joel struggles with the consequences of his choices; Ellie struggles to trust him while wrestling with her immunity to the outbreak and what good it could have done. There’s a way in which she’s untouched by the problem everyone else is having—she can’t get the disease that has taken so much from the world—but, as the player knows, any possibility that she could have done something about it is long dead.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I would have gladly played a version of <em>The Last of Us 2 </em>that explored these themes, that, like the first game, focused on the very human struggles of its characters set against a grim and brutal world. But that’s not the game we get. Inevitably, a violent tragedy ensues in Jackson. (That’s all I can tell you about it for now.) Ellie sets off on a revenge quest that consumes the rest of the game, which sends you to Seattle, puts you between two warring groups, and—those restrictions again!—escalates in gruesome ways.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The game sends you on its revenge quest in a way that feels both narratively relentless and physically slow. In the early parts of the game, there are long stretches between combat and narrative in which you laboriously pick your way through the ruins of Seattle. By the middle of the game, I was fighting through consecutive tense areas that took time to navigate, and I’d long for a breather so my heart could stop pounding. Other times, something terrible would happen, only for me to be thrown back into combat without a moment to take it in. Tragic story events happened one after another. The game is divided into chapters, but events sometimes escalate without offering a natural stopping point, pushing me on even as I recoiled from what I’d witnessed.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"tcahy54ieww5lrdsirrh\" data-recommend-id=\"image://tcahy54ieww5lrdsirrh\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"tcahy54ieww5lrdsirrh\" data-recommend-id=\"image://tcahy54ieww5lrdsirrh\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Almost every moment in <em>The Last of Us 2</em> is hard. Much like in the first game, it takes forever to get anywhere, and so many objects in your way need to be lifted, pulled, and pried via button presses. Here, you can also crawl under things, squeeze through tight gaps, and throw and climb ropes, which you have to slowly gather one coil at a time. The obstacles in the first game created a pace that made sense—you were traveling across the country, after all—and here the new and old features combine evocatively with the size and wilderness of Seattle to make it feel treacherous. While <em>The Last of Us 2</em> never quite pulls off the beauty of the original’s <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfapMy-mIXo\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfapMy-mIXo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">giraffe moment</a></span>, the nature that’s overtaken Seattle is gorgeous and awe-inspiring. Rapids crash through what used to be downtown streets, trees tower overhead, and the damp, lush greenery feel both prehistoric and so much like the Pacific Northwest. Nature also makes progress difficult; I often hit so many dead ends and overgrown areas in my journey toward a waypoint that I lost all sense of my initial destination until dialogue or a prompt reminded me.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Combat seldom picks up the pace. It works fairly similarly to the first game: you’re neither a tank nor a ninja. You’re always outnumbered, and ammunition and crafting parts are in painfully short supply. You can improve your odds a bit via several skill trees, which are unlocked with findable manuals and upgradable with findable pills. There are skills that give you more health, make you move faster when prone, or let you craft more quickly. You can also upgrade your guns at workbenches using scavenged parts, reducing sway or increasing damage. All of this necessitates scavenging, which you’ll also need to do to find parts to craft pipe bombs, molotovs, and certain kinds of ammo. This search draws out combat moments: you’ll kill a few enemies, detour to rummage through drawers for supplies, hide somewhere to craft, and then head back to the fight. I enjoyed this pace, even when it made me ache for an encounter to be over.<br></p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"The Last Of Us Part 2\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"the-last-of-us-part-2\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Your best bet in combat is to sneak around picking off enemies one by one, aided by the “listening” ability that lets you see their outlines through walls. You can hide behind cover, or go prone in grass, but none of this is quite as sharp as it would be in a true stealth game. In most of my battles, something inevitably went wrong and multiple enemies would rush me. In these moments, I had better luck running frantically than standing my ground, where scarcity made head-on battles difficult and wasteful. Combat went the best for me when enemies would come to investigate a downed colleague and I could pick them off individually, or when they were far enough apart that I could take them down unseen. In these instances, I’d fall into a compelling rhythm of sneaking and grabbing. But then a particularly dangerous Infected would appear who’d require too much attention or ammo, or I’d run out of crafting materials necessary to keep fighting, or the door I’d finally made it to was locked and I knew it would be another real-world hour before I moved the story forward. None of this is bad—it’s a feel unique to <em>The Last of Us</em>, combining some of my favorite sensations of survival and stealth games—but it wore me out. As the game grew more difficult to stomach, the pace of the combat sometimes felt like punishment. I’d long to be done with what I was experiencing, only to have no choice but to trudge through it.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If <em>The Last of Us 2</em> was just a game where its story unfolded between characters while you played slow combat and explored nature, I would have found it fine. If it kept the emotional weight of the original, the relatable ways the characters’ relationships formed and dissolved, it would have resonated with me the way the first game did. I played that game for the first time with friends on release day; one of my friends, a comedian, did most of the playing as the weekend wore on. She made such great jokes while she did—the hilarious internal monologue she spun for Joel sticks in my memory seven years later—but as we played, the jokes faded out. We both sobbed at the end. It felt like we’d shared something incredibly special, an experience a game had never given us before. I’ve played the game on my own since, as well as the <em>Left Behind</em> DLC, but they’ve never affected me as much as seeing the original’s final moments for the first time.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"kwl2un5xurdohgk04agc\" data-recommend-id=\"image://kwl2un5xurdohgk04agc\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"kwl2un5xurdohgk04agc\" data-recommend-id=\"image://kwl2un5xurdohgk04agc\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">T<em>he Last of Us 2</em> didn’t give me any moments like that. In the above-quoted video, Druckmann says the core of the game is about “these really intimate, intense relationships.” I bring this up not to quote the game’s marketing, but to try to understand what the people who made it thought they were doing. The story I experienced was about relationships only insofar as characters did things to each other. I didn’t learn anything about what it means to be human, or what we’re capable of when we’re hurt, or what can happen when we want to hurt others. The way Joel hurt Ellie in <em>The Last of Us</em> felt relatable to me; even if the fate of humanity has never hung in the balance, I know how it feels to make a desperate, selfish choice to hang on to something you love. <em>The Last of Us 2</em>’s amount of cruelty and violence ultimately overwhelmed any chance of that relatability here. I didn’t find it prurient—the game doesn’t relish in its gory deaths or emotional suffering. It just takes every opportunity to show them, over and over, and decides that counts as saying something about them. It showed me so much ugliness, and in such detail, that I felt numb as terrible things befell more characters I cared about. Sometimes I did these terrible things myself, through gameplay. Sometimes I just watched things play out in front of me with no say in the matter, a lack of agency that was so skillfully used in the first game. Neither circumstance felt more affecting than the other; both just felt like <em>more</em>. The game’s diversity, which I appreciated at the beginning, just felt like an equal opportunity for different kinds of people to suffer as the game went on. Eventually, my numbness turned to an anger I’ve never felt about a video game. Late one night, I paused the game and asked myself aloud if the developers thought I was stupid, if they thought the existence of violence had just never occurred to me before.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s difficult to talk about all of this a week before most of you reading can play the game for yourself. In a recent fawning piece in British <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/the-last-of-us-part-ii-neil-druckmann-interview\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/the-last-of-us-part-ii-neil-druckmann-interview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>GQ</em></a></span>, Druckmann is quoted as saying, “There were people [at Naughty Dog]—a minority of them—that were just stuck on how violent it [the game] is and how dark and quite cynical it is about mankind.” That even the people who made the game are divided about it is a clear sign that players are going to have radically different experiences. The first game’s story was polarizing; this one’s will clearly be as well. So many people worked on this game for so long, and at <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/as-naughty-dog-crunches-on-the-last-of-us-ii-developer-1842289962\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/as-naughty-dog-crunches-on-the-last-of-us-ii-developer-1842289962\">such cost</a></span>, that I want <em>The Last Of Us 2 </em>to be more than the experience I had. It’s a visually beautiful game that feels distinct to play, and the story it tells and how it tells it, at the most basic level, certainly pushes the edges of what games have done before. None of those accomplishments elevated or redeemed it for me. Like the nature consuming Seattle, or the outbreak consuming humanity, its ugliness overshadowed everything else. </p>', '2024-01-10 17:12:01', '2024-01-10 17:12:01', 'The Last Of Us Part 2: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/xvvkwfpqbsj12rokxaqf.jpg', 'ps4', 'https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-the-kotaku-review-1844006193', 'Everything in The Last of Us 2 takes work.

Your personal level of yearning to see Sega’s long-dormant rhythm game series make a comeback is likely to be proportional to the amount of fun you have with this week’s <em>Space Channel 5 VR Kinda Funky News Flash </em>for PlayStation VR. At its essence, it’s a simple, brief dance game, but the chance to step into its iconic universe is a fan’s dream.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">When Sega released <em>Space Channel 5</em> for the Dreamcast 20 years ago, the company was at the peak of its creativity. <em>Space Channel 5 </em>was a rhythm game following the broadcasts of a futuristic, vinyl-clad television news reporter whose on-camera appearances are invariably set to hot dance moves. It fit in perfectly with the console’s similarly stylish, offbeat ideas like <em>Jet Set Radio</em>, <em>Crazy Taxi</em>, and <em>Samba De Amigo</em>. The Dreamcast game’s development team, led by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, went on to make <em>Rez</em>, which has had a more robust post-Dreamcast life, including its own VR version. (Mizuguchi wasn’t involved in <em>Kinda Funky News Flash</em>, but other key members of the original team were.)</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Rather than remake the original game, the creators of <em>Kinda Funky News Flash</em> are telling a new story, although it once again pits heroine Ulala against a variety of aliens who want to get into deadly dance-offs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The major difference in this new version is that instead of pressing up, down, left, and right on a Dreamcast controller to do the moves, you’re moving a pair of PlayStation Move controllers, making <em>Space Channel 5 VR</em> more of a dance game than a strict beat-matching one.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Probably the smartest design decision here is that you are not playing as Ulala. You’re playing as a rookie reporter standing behind and to the right of Ulala. That means the iconic news anchor herself is there in the scene you’re seeing, part of the spectacle, instead of you being awkwardly Malkoviched into her head. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You also get the benefit of being able to watch Ulala do the exact dance moves you’re supposed to be doing, which I guess would be helpful if you don’t already get the call-and-response gameplay of the <em>Space Channel 5</em> series. First, the aliens dance a few steps, which is mostly just waving your arms in the four cardinal directions. Then you repeat what they did. Get it wrong four times in a row, and it’s game over.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Besides the classic up, down, left, right, and “chu” (arms in front), you’ll also hear “pose” a lot. This is not a specific position—instead, you’ll have to watch your opponent and mimic their positioning. You’ll also occasionally have to dodge their attacks by moving your body to the left and right.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 rlnFM align--center js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"ncla1mwctyhallktmfpw\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ncla1mwctyhallktmfpw\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"360\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"ncla1mwctyhallktmfpw\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ncla1mwctyhallktmfpw\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"360\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">At first, I started out playing <em>Kinda Funky News Flash</em> as if it were, like its predecessors, a precision-timed beat-matching game. I’d snap my arms into the pose positions right on the beat. This actually worked well enough to get me through all four levels, but I’d often miss a lot of beats I thought I should have hit perfectly. As it turns out, I was pretty much doing it wrong. It seems like the game is just checking to make sure that the PlayStation Move controller’s glowy balls are in the right position at the right time in the song. So that means when they say “Chu, chu, chu!” and Ulala throws her hands in front of her three times in a row, you can just hold your hands in that position and register all three hits.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The tutorial doesn’t tell you this. Nor does it explain about the “secrets” you’re supposed to collect in each level. It turns out that they’re little circular patterns that appear at various times throughout the levels, and you’re supposed to reach out and hit them with your hand. I honestly thought they were weird loading icons or something, and my mind started to actually ignore them because I was so concentrated on the rest of the action. I only figured it out right as the game was ending.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">That happened pretty shortly after it began. Much like the first <em>Space Channel 5</em>, which you can finish in well under an hour if you don’t fail a level, you can polish off <em>Kinda Funky News Flash </em>during a sufficiently long lunch break. The ending sequence is interactive and fun as well, so maybe we’ll call it four and a <em>half</em> levels. But it’s still pretty short.</p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Space Channel 5 VR: Kinda Funky News Flash!\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"space-channel-5-vr-kinda-funky-news-flash\">\n\n</section></aside>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">What’s there to do when you’re done? Not a whole lot. You can replay levels for 100 percent completion, but unlike the original game, <em>Kinda Funky</em> doesn’t add harder or more complex versions of those levels for your second playthrough. There’s a mode that lets you play 100 levels in a row with more and more dance moves, although that’s pretty much just hanging out in a single virtual area, and thus gets a little repetitive.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I don’t want to get too deep into what actually happens during the story, because that’s a great deal of the fun, and because as I’ve said, it’s such a brief ride that each little unexpected story beat is a precious moment. Although I suppose that if you have no intention of playing it, you can convert the final clause of this sentence out of ROT13 to find out that at one point Ulala ends up pehpvsvrq ba n tvnag svqtrg fcvaare. It was weird!</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The most important thing to say is that this is an authentic <em>Space Channel 5</em> experience. The wacky situations, the charming dialogue, the classy dance moves, the signature sounds of the classic 1966 jazz anthem “Mexican Flyer”—it’s all here, and it’s as timeless an aesthetic as it was 20 years ago. If that’s all you’ve wanted to hear, you’ll be as excited as I am for this interstellar dance adventure. Just know that it’ll be a short trip.</p>', '2024-01-10 17:12:01', '2024-01-10 17:12:01', 'Space Channel 5 VR: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/bkbicm2jmzpu0cvebgqt.jpg', 'ps4', 'https://kotaku.com/space-channel-5-vr-the-kotaku-review-1841910281', 'How badly do you want to play another Space Channel 5 game?

The game’s setting is lush and alive, its narrative heartwarming: A latchkey kid named Ash constantly revisits the ruins of Denska, the once-thriving port town he grew up in, to doodle. Denska has been abandoned and overtaken by Darkness, a mysterious force with the physical form of thorned purple vines, but Ash can’t stand to let the town go. He’s faced with the opportunity to take action, given a magical brush and a mission to restore the ghost town’s beauty. With a masterful sense of visual storytelling, the story is charming in its simplicity, full to bursting with warm, colorful memories and touching moments.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"j7vrga2q1l39yv6oyotm\" data-recommend-id=\"image://j7vrga2q1l39yv6oyotm\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"j7vrga2q1l39yv6oyotm\" data-recommend-id=\"image://j7vrga2q1l39yv6oyotm\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong><em>This piece was first published at midnight.</em></strong></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The gameplay never quite lives up to the loving design of the ramshackle town. After maybe 10 hours  scouring for secrets and messing around in free play mode, I wasn’t pulling my hair out. I just got a little bored with it. That did make it painful when I reached the short-lived final act, a total upturning of its mechanics, and realized that the gameplay was actually getting <em>good</em>.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"rlufouhmcpjvnmyzujxy\" data-recommend-id=\"image://rlufouhmcpjvnmyzujxy\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"rlufouhmcpjvnmyzujxy\" data-recommend-id=\"image://rlufouhmcpjvnmyzujxy\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Ash progresses by moving through city streets and across rooftops with the aid of his Genies, creatures he’s drawn in his sketchbook. Each setting—a derelict lighthouse or a deserted hydroelectric plant, for example—features similar objectives. You must paint walls adorned by lightbulbs to illuminate them; find pages of your destroyed sketchbook, which can include new designs for the walls or the Genies themselves; and find spots to create new Genies. In the process, you can find newspaper clippings that provide extra context about the city of Denska, the environmental disaster that totaled it, and the tough-as-nails townsfolk who stuck it out for as long as they could before having to leave. Denska is still full of signs of life: leftover bottles and cars, neglected storefronts with stacks of CRT TVs, cheerful advertisements fading to a sullen gray. While finding one newspaper clipping, Ash remembers aloud the moment his family realized it was over: “when mom realized there was no place in town to buy milk.” It’s a simple story, expertly told.<br></p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"wkuzw8isxxhb9oulpd3b\" data-recommend-id=\"image://wkuzw8isxxhb9oulpd3b\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"wkuzw8isxxhb9oulpd3b\" data-recommend-id=\"image://wkuzw8isxxhb9oulpd3b\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The problem is, playing through the game gets boring. After your first encounter with the Genies, you’re able to graffiti up most of Denska’s walls using either motion controls or the right stick. At certain locations, you can create new Genies with a similar interface, starting with the body and adding designs like horns, ears and tails. While there’s not an incredible amount of variety across the several bodies you get, the creatures are a clear nod to <em>Where the Wild Things Are</em> and carry with them a real charm. The landscape options, anything from redwood trees and storm lilies to mushrooms and balloon plants, all look good, as do dynamic effects like the rain, which continues to fall whenever you pass by the wall. Butterflies and birds flutter outward from your brush, to your Genies’ great delight. But you get a total of 48 of these options to mess with, 12 each between four areas, and in a post-<em>Little Big Planet</em> world, it wasn’t enough to justify how much repetitive painting I had to do across wall after wall.</p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Concrete Genie\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"concrete-genie\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">At the end of each area, you’re invited to paint a “masterpiece,” a larger mural, where your Genies will have suggestions about what to put up. Despite the monotony, doing this is fun and sometimes happens in cool places, like a section where you climb high above the city and can see the entire town. Along the way, you can also find billboards to spruce up where you need the correct design. Completing puzzles like this unlocks rewards like concept art, which, unsurprisingly, is stunning.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"ys2jhgefyuxpdqqek9rq\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ys2jhgefyuxpdqqek9rq\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2878\" data-height=\"1616\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"ys2jhgefyuxpdqqek9rq\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ys2jhgefyuxpdqqek9rq\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2878\" data-height=\"1616\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Each of the three Genie types has its own powers, which can do things like set parts of the environment on fire for you to pass through. Puzzles largely consist of clearing Darkness so that your Genies can get through and magic away environmental obstacles. Sometimes, you have to paint a design the Genie requests in order to get them to help you, but that doesn’t add much and ultimately feels like a chore. Seeing some of the Genies’ interactions with your landscape paint is cute, but when the puzzles are already tedious, having to draw, I don’t know, some grass before your Genie will cooperate gets old.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"vwuqulrftdtswvlyo16b\" data-recommend-id=\"image://vwuqulrftdtswvlyo16b\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"vwuqulrftdtswvlyo16b\" data-recommend-id=\"image://vwuqulrftdtswvlyo16b\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Concrete Genie</em> rarely requires any real problem solving. This is one issue I can just barely excuse because it seems to have been made for a younger audience. Puzzles are straightforward, and the Genie you need to progress is always the next one you find, precluding any real puzzling beyond exploring and finding new areas. But undermining this is the fact that the gameplay often feels undercooked. Even as an adult, I found myself occasionally confused about how to progress. The game aggressively offers hints, which felt like a bandaid on moments of loose design. The puzzles generally featured only one way to progress, and the way forward, no matter whether that was using a water valve or flipping a switch, was generally to interact with the one interactive thing and then call your Genies. That was occasionally marred by the fact that it wasn’t always clear, for example, when a Genie would be blocked by Darkness given the nonlinear way they move through walls. Ultimately, it felt like there was this rich, beautiful world and too little to do in it.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"reankjukxaabs8watb20\" data-recommend-id=\"image://reankjukxaabs8watb20\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2644\" data-height=\"1486\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"reankjukxaabs8watb20\" data-recommend-id=\"image://reankjukxaabs8watb20\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2644\" data-height=\"1486\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You sometimes have to avoid bullies as you progress. Learning more about the kids who torment Ash with Senseless Kids’ Movie Thuggery is interesting, but the “stealth” really just requires you to jump on any nearby rooftop and you can’t be caught. Like the rest of the game, it works well narratively but fails to be fun.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"xeurym1alsygjkpsy5zm\" data-recommend-id=\"image://xeurym1alsygjkpsy5zm\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"xeurym1alsygjkpsy5zm\" data-recommend-id=\"image://xeurym1alsygjkpsy5zm\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I felt this frustration most when I got closer to the end, where the gameplay…actually got cool. After a certain point, the mechanics entirely switch and you’re in pursuit and combat situations, with abilities like “Paint Skating,” which allows you to glide around the town more quickly, and you get fireballs to shoot enemies with. Without giving too much away, you have to fight and then tame beasts using a number of offensive magical powers you get. You even get a <em>dodge roll</em> to use, which was far better than trudging around the streets of Denska like a regular, non-magical <em>pedestrian</em>. The  action section is far more fun than sneaking around Ash’s bullies and painting by number. The story continues to pick up here as well as Ash confronts his tormentors in a deeply affecting, earnest final act. Unfortunately, this part of the game is short-lived after the slog it takes to get there, but the decision to end on this note was a smart one. If only <em>Concrete Geni</em> had gotten there sooner or stayed there longer.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"l5ykldgoffjz92zr2qwj\" data-recommend-id=\"image://l5ykldgoffjz92zr2qwj\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"l5ykldgoffjz92zr2qwj\" data-recommend-id=\"image://l5ykldgoffjz92zr2qwj\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The story of <em>Concrete Genie</em> is well-told and relatable, a classic bullies-turned-friends story of empathy and growth with some real storytelling flair, including striking illustrations and a masterful, coherent use of a variety of art styles. The account of environmental disaster and a fishing town struggling to survive is rooted and told well from Ash’s young perspective. Pixelopus has a clear understanding of what makes a story work, even a story done as many times as this one: bullying, empathy, reconciliation. The fact that the game is gorgeous goes a long way, too. With the amount of love and care poured into the storytelling, I wanted more from the gameplay. If the first part of <em>Concrete Genie</em> were more tightly done, it could have easily been one of my favorite games of the year.  But like the fishing town of Denska itself, it faded before I could really appreciate it.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"pqy83rafavwsipunwcuc\" data-recommend-id=\"image://pqy83rafavwsipunwcuc\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"pqy83rafavwsipunwcuc\" data-recommend-id=\"image://pqy83rafavwsipunwcuc\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>', '2024-01-10 17:12:01', '2024-01-10 17:12:01', 'Concrete Genie Takes Too Long To Get To The Fun Stuff', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/zfftdzl63nyzk6z7dwfu.jpg', 'ps4', 'https://kotaku.com/concrete-genie-takes-too-long-to-get-to-the-fun-stuff-1838863633', 'When I started Concrete Genie, a new PlayStation 4 exclusive out now from Pixelo...', '');

You’re still given almost free reign over the fictional Tokyo distruct of Kamurocho, and you’re still running around getting into fistfights, buying energy drinks from convenience stores and getting caught up in a very elaborate tale about mobsters (try as they might, even with a name change, <!-- -->the studio just can’t stay <!-- -->away from the Yakuza).</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It is, at least, a new cast and a new story. Gone is the cartoonish excess of Kiryu and friends, replaced with a more earthy and earnest protagonist named Takayuki Yagami, a disgraced lawyer now working as a private eye. He ushers in a change of tone that permeates the entire game, for better and worse.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Better first!

Yagami’s tale may be pinned to a massive and often farcical conspiracy, but its beats and conclusion are really just a very personal and small-scale story about a man out for redemption. In doing so it also keeps the slapstick and bombastic set pieces to a minimum, a handful of literally explosive acts aside.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"rk14sewzwb0xnohfpyhr\" data-recommend-id=\"image://rk14sewzwb0xnohfpyhr\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"rk14sewzwb0xnohfpyhr\" data-recommend-id=\"image://rk14sewzwb0xnohfpyhr\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Notably for virtual tourists, for the first time since <em>Yakuza 2</em> we never leave the streets of Kanurocho during the course of the game, and the usual sprawling cast of gangsters has been replaced with a smaller, more manageable roster of friends and enemies that gives each far more space to grow, and for us to get to know them.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">All of which made <em>Judgment </em>a far more intimate experience than any of the recent <em>Yakuza </em>games, and I appreciated that immensely. The brevity even extends to the game’s overall design: this is a leaner, meaner affair, with most sidequests relegated to a jobs board in your office (so you don’t continually run into them on the streets) and a main story that can be wrapped up in around 20-25 hours. Even the series’ notoriously lengthy cutscenes have been trimmed, with few outside of the most pivotal moments clocking in at any longer than a few minutes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The downside to this tonal shift is that there’s now a strange gulf between the narrative that’s been crafted and the actual experience of playing. This is still very much a <em>Yakuza</em> game at heart, so you spend most of your time kicking bikes into dude’s faces, facing down hordes of street thugs with your bare hands and running around performing hilarious side-missions. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">That kind of stuff made sense when the characters you were playing as were as off-kilter as the action on screen, but here there’s a dissonance, where the feats you’re pulling off in combat are at odds with the more sombre and grounded action taking place in cutscenes. I mean, it’s explained very briefly that hey, your ex-lawyer detective guy also knows martial arts, but there’s a difference between “have done some karate” and “can beat the shit out of 12 cops without breaking a sweat”.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"jcpjexexti7y2khz1fvb\" data-recommend-id=\"image://jcpjexexti7y2khz1fvb\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1841\" data-height=\"1029\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"jcpjexexti7y2khz1fvb\" data-recommend-id=\"image://jcpjexexti7y2khz1fvb\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1841\" data-height=\"1029\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Not helping matters here is that in attempt to bridge that gulf, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio have implemented some new systems into the game designed to play on its crime-solving, court case-winning vibe, which range from pixel hunts to <em>Phoenix Wright</em>-style accusations and presentations of evidence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Nearly all of them suck, and do little but place a handbrake on your adventures, as though they were simply implemented for the sake of it, to differentiate this slightly from the <em>Yakuza </em>games, rather than because they genuinely added something to the experience. The accusations are the most disappointing, since they can’t be failed and as such are of little consequence, but the <em>worst </em>are the seemingly endless tailing/stealth sections, which are broken, take forever and are generally a nightmare to endure.</p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Judgment\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"judgment\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s been suspected for a long time now, but free of <em>Yakuza’s</em> history <em>Judgment </em>finally gives us a chance to prove it: the real star of these games has never been their cast but their setting. Kamurocho is a video game wonder, whose consistency across games, despite its continual changes, makes it the PlayStation equivalent of a comfortable pair of slippers. And in <em>Judgment</em>, it’s never looked better.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Setting the entire game here, without the customary vacations to places like Osaka or Okinawa that we’ve gotten used to lately could have felt cramped, but the distance <em>Judgment </em>puts between itself and its <em>Yakuza </em>past lets us see the city in a new light. It’s a strangely comforting—and novel in an industry that’s always desperate to take you to new places—experience to be able to revisit some of the key locations of a series that’s over 15 years old, and what in a <em>Yakuza </em>game was a key location is in <em>Judgment </em>just some bar you can buy a beer in.

I’ve always wanted to complain about<em> Yakuza’s</em> lack of a true fast travel system (you can only bounce around the borders of the district), but then I know deep down that the games are better without it, as being forced to walk the city’s streets is the best way to get to know them.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I moved house last month, and it’s both terrifying but also amazing that over the course of this review I found I knew the streets of Kamurocho better than those of my actual neighbourhood.

I really enjoyed my time with <em>Judgment</em>, partly because I took a shine to the new, more human cast, but mostly because the basic <em>Yakuza </em>building blocks of “smashing traffic cones into ribs” married with “a soap opera about angry dudes” is still loads of fun.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It would have been nice if those two things could have been stitched together a little more neatly, but then subtlety has never been a <em>Yakuza </em>strongpoint.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"beruxkabzu8vzsrmk95c\" data-recommend-id=\"image://beruxkabzu8vzsrmk95c\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"460\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"beruxkabzu8vzsrmk95c\" data-recommend-id=\"image://beruxkabzu8vzsrmk95c\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"460\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>', '2024-01-10 17:12:01', '2024-01-10 17:12:01', 'Judgment: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/g8wppifo2ah186lsgtrk.jpg', 'ps4', 'https://kotaku.com/judgment-the-kotaku-review-1835790070', 'Yakuza 6 closed the book on the story of fabled gangster Kazuma Kiryu, but Ryu G...', ''),

There are people who must do it for a living: government employees who specialize in disaster relief and crisis response, civil engineers, military personnel—people who must imagine the end to make sure it never comes. But there are others: Fundamentalist evangelicals waiting for a rapture. Libertarian preppers who shun government and pride themselves on self-sufficiency. Conspiracy theorists and internet nihilists. Anyone remotely concerned with the future of the planet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">For most people, this is optional. You choose to be someone who thinks about the end, and that choice colors your attitude in the present, for good or ill. In video games, however, the doom of civilization is old hat. It’s so familiar that we’ve moved past it, affixing a genre name to what comes after: The post-apocalypse, where we find games like the new single player PlayStation 4 exclusive <em>Days Gone.</em></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Post-apocalyptic stories are an easy mark for video games to hit, precisely because they justify all sorts of behavior that’s hard to deal with in any other setting. For developers interested in rooting video games in believable narratives, they’re liberating. They provide a context in which violent people with sticky fingers seem pretty reasonable. The trouble, then, comes when a game tells a story within this familiar context, and ultimately finds itself trapped by its tropes. <em>Days Gone</em> displays little that reaches beyond its many influences and contemporaries, instead settling for being a hollow simulacrum of them all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">***</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In <em>Days Gone</em> you play as a man named Deacon St. John. He survives in the forests of rural Oregon after the end of the world, when hordes of rabid, zombie-like monsters called Freakers overran everything, bringing about society’s collapse. Deacon’s past life as a member of the Mongrels MC biker gang makes him ideally suited to life in The Shit, as they call it, and also ideally suited to being a video game protagonist. He has a motorcycle he rides, cares for, and improves. He’s proficient with firearms, and has zero qualms about using them. He has a sympathetic past, where he is separated from his wife at the end of everything, and presumes her dead. And he has a code, one that mostly just involves rage at anyone who dares point a gun at an unarmed woman.<br></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">There isn’t much to Deacon that doesn’t seem like it’s there for the purpose of making a video game, and a very specific kind of video game at that. You know what kind of game, because you’ve likely played it more than once: A third-person action game with guns for shooting and cudgels for swinging and recipes for crafting weapons. A game where you scrounge for vague resources like “scrap” and “rags,” encounter different factions of humans that want you dead, and various phenotypes of Freaker to be wary of, and between all of them, endless corpses to loot. And, of course, there are experience points and skill trees with abilities to unlock.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">These systems are all standard-issue, part of the industrial hum of big-budget video games. They’re like a laugh track in a sitcom—standard operating procedure for a work of mass appeal, even if it signals creative complacency. Including them is fine, but it puts more pressure on the other aspects of a game to elevate the whole. </p>\n\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Days Gone\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"days-gone\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">There’s not much you can point to in <em>Days Gone</em> if you were looking for a calling card, a signature feature that makes it distinctive. The easiest place to look for this is in the motorcycle that you, as Deacon, spend the game using. It can be upgraded, though there are only about a handful of upgrades for every major part, improving things such as speed, traction, damage resistance, and fuel tank size. The cosmetic improvements are more plentiful, but also limited—you can only paint so much of the bike’s frame, or apply a unique skin wholesale. You don’t spec the bike out to handle different situations. It is improved as a matter of course, when the game makes new parts available to you and a faster, hardier bike would come in handy.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Since <em>Days Gone</em> requires you to be near your bike to save or fast travel, and because you need enough gas in the tank in order to make the trip, you must be responsible with fuel management. You also should stop and make repairs whenever your bike takes too much damage. There’s the implication that your potential interactions with your motorcycle might make for something meaningful and distinct, a bike that’s yours in a way that extends beyond a paint job and a cool headlamp. Instead, the game treats the motorcycle the way other games treat horses. It’s your ride. It gets the job done in such a strictly efficient way you might altogether forget that motorcycles are, in fact, awesome.  </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">***</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The glut of post-apocalyptic fiction in pop culture at large and video games in particular has led to a set of beliefs and tropes that have settled into the bones of these stories: A moral nihilism that posits compassion as weakness, that the ends justify the means, that there is a thin line protecting us from them and it extends directly from the barrel of a gun. In the post-apocalypse, we hold these truths to be self-evident, to challenge them is to rail against gravity.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"oyg6ean2uh4v6za44epv\" data-recommend-id=\"image://oyg6ean2uh4v6za44epv\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"oyg6ean2uh4v6za44epv\" data-recommend-id=\"image://oyg6ean2uh4v6za44epv\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Days Gone</em> almost dares to grapple with this, to argue that maybe there’s virtue in pushing against the mean math of survival that we’ve come to accept as necessary and obvious, something more to the preservation of society than guns in the hands of people who believe in order and rule of law. It puts these notions in the mouths of characters who argue with Deacon, a drifter for whom getting by is the only thing that matters.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Toward the end of the game’s first act, you meet the most prominent voice that pushes against Deacon’s drifter philosophy: Iron Mike, a man who’s forged a treaty with the most hostile human enemies in the game and believes in the sanctity of life for all, even the monstrous. “Caring will get you killed,” Deacon tells him, believing Iron Mike to be a fool. “Not caring will get you killed just as easy,” he replies.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Instead of having Deacon wrestle with these ideas and giving players meaningful ways of engaging with them, the game instead introduces a series of antagonists unquestionably worse than the existential threat of the Freaker hordes and Deacon’s ambiguous morality, villains who force everyone to put these debates aside, or even yield to survival tropes and their tired absolutes. It sidelines any sense of self-examination its narrative might lead to, and buries it further by wrapping it all up in a story of love, brotherhood, and a drifter learning to call a place home again. It’s a saccharine frame that attempts to paper over messy, incoherent themes with sentiment, only to draw more attention to them. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">***</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Playing <em>Days Gone</em> is a lot like playing most other games of its stature. You will visit camps populated by merchants to buy gear from and characters to talk to. Those characters will send you out on jobs, usually involving finding something or someone or killing something or someone. They’re all solid, with the exception of frequent, bafflingly bad stealth missions where you must spy on government researchers, staying close enough to eavesdrop while avoiding their armed escorts. Stealth in <em>Days Gone</em> is basic to the point of hilarity—crouch in a bush up to Deacon’s neck and every character will treat you as invisible—but these missions frustrate by making guards invincible, and by arbitrarily restricting you from using rocks to distract them. Get spotted once, and you have to restart them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Barring that low, most of the game’s main and side missions hold steady. The best missions are the mostly optional freaker hordes. Hordes are the most technically impressive thing in <em>Days Gone</em>, massive, frightening swarms of freakers that seem to number in the hundreds. (It’s impossible to count them but you can guess by the number of bounties they leave behind for you to collect—one horde left me with over 200.) Freaker hordes require planning to take out, and will overrun you if all you do is square up with a really big gun. They also have a way of wandering into places you need to be for other missions, and have the nice effect of being the one genuinely chilling, panic-inducing thing in a game that’s about a zombie apocalypse. Taking on a horde is thrilling and fun in a way that makes everything else feel mundane.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"omgbvuozr1unxighuqua\" data-recommend-id=\"image://omgbvuozr1unxighuqua\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"2560\" data-height=\"1440\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"omgbvuozr1unxighuqua\" data-recommend-id=\"image://omgbvuozr1unxighuqua\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"2560\" data-height=\"1440\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">There are a few thoughtful touches in its design that suggest <em>Days Gone</em>’s developers have sympathy for the player of large big-budget games. Instead of a standard quest log, <em>Days Gone</em> tracks your progress through various “storylines.” A few, like the storyline that tasks you with the optional task of clearing out Freaker nests you find in the world, are glorified to-do lists. Most, however, are a genuine attempt to keep track of how every mission advances each subplot and character arc, doubling as a good way to remind yourself of story beats after time away. All of them clearly denote your rewards for completing each mission and do a lot to help you prioritize what’s worthwhile in a given session and what’s best saved for later, or skipped entirely.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">On the other hand, there are times where <em>Days Gone</em> seems to be barely holding it together, with frequent bugs that run the gamut from amusing to frustrating. A puddle on a bridge somehow became an ocean, swallowing me and drowning me in the river beneath. The frame rate stuttered and occasionally froze outright for a few seconds. And the audio was generally a mess, with gunfire occasionally going silent, my motorcycle engine revving while idle, and dialogue coming in at volumes that make it hard to determine who is talking: too low for parts of long motorcycle rides, or too loud in comparison to the sound of the engine that suddenly dipped for no reason.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Through it all, the game remained playable and only crashed once on my Playstation 4 Pro, late in my 30-hour playthrough, corrupting a save file I had created just before things went haywire. Fortunately, <em>Days Gone</em> is generous with autosaves, and I never felt in danger of losing a lot of progress. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Despite its substantial bugginess, there’s an efficiency to the design of <em>Days Gone</em>. It’s very easy to keep playing, unoriginal as much of it is.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">***<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"ldgshgjlfha1fbcdsp07\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ldgshgjlfha1fbcdsp07\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"ldgshgjlfha1fbcdsp07\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ldgshgjlfha1fbcdsp07\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But we were talking about the end of the world.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">A possible explanation for video games’ love affair with the oxymoron of the post-apocalypse is that it is reductive: Doomsday means the end of most everything, and that means we can wipe away all the complicated and contradictory and messy rules and feelings that come with humanity and in their stead, replace them with something more primal. Have you survived or not? It’s a simple binary, and as elaborate systems run by computers, video games are very good at handling binaries. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The problem comes when video games rig the score. <em>Days Gone</em> is a third-person action game with a layer of survival baked in. It’s about shooting things and foraging for useful equipment to better your chances at staying alive in an increasingly hostile environment. Those are expressed through play, and even when said play is derivative as <em>Days Gone</em> is, it can still be compelling.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Deciding what that <em>means</em> through narrative is something else altogether, and where the tropes of the post-apocalypse become most grating. In <em>Days Gone</em>, Deacon St. John has done horrible things, and so has everyone else. Deacon and his cohorts would like things to not be this way, but they are, and them’s the breaks. And it is tiresome<em>. </em>It is exhausting to watch another gruff white dude experience the extremes of humanity brought about by disaster, to be torn between pure, reliable self-interest and the fragile strength of community, as if those are the only two ways to be. It’s dumping water into the ocean, failing to offer anything new in favor of blending formlessly into arguments made by 10 years of <em>The Walking Dead</em> and countless post-apocalyptic games of its ilk. Look no further than the game developers calling the zombies “freakers,” and expecting us to take that as something new.</p>', '2024-01-10 17:12:01', '2024-01-10 17:12:01', 'Days Gone: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/zidwsvlelpazppjfhzax.jpg', 'ps4', 'https://kotaku.com/days-gone-the-kotaku-review-1834287975', 'It’s worthwhile to think about the number of people around you who are waiting f...', ''),

It<!-- -->s enormous mechs are a somewhat trickier proposition.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">A fact that hasn’t stopped Maolo one bit, with this Eva-01 cosplay that’s as remarkable for its finish as it is for <!-- -->its flexibility. While the pic up top (and the one below) look like they’re promo shots for a very expensive action figure, they’re actually a functional suit—complete with lighting—that gives Maolo a full range of movement.</p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"de961518f551393476ea769b3214448f\" data-recommend-id=\"image://de961518f551393476ea769b3214448f\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"1365\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"de961518f551393476ea769b3214448f\" data-recommend-id=\"image://de961518f551393476ea769b3214448f\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"1365\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The 01 here is Maolo’s third attempt at an <em>Evangelion</em> unit outfit, so they’ve learned a thing or two over the years. It’s<!-- --> the result of a whopping seven months of work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If you’re wondering how the suit can look so crisp while also being so flexible, Maolo has leaned on the classics here for inspiration. Nearly the entire unit is made of pieces of foam that have been individually wrapped in coloured, synthetic leather, which unlike painted pieces can look a lot smoother and metallic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s a technique that allows for a suit that both looks and moves well, and is the way shows like <em>Power Rangers </em>(and countless other tokusatsu series) have been made for decades.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I’ve mentioned a few times now how the suit moves without actually showing it, so here’s a short video Maolo made that highlights how the suit allows for a surprisingly quick and natural range of movement for something that’s so angular and has so many pieces.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You can see more of Maolo’s amazing cosplay work <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://twitter.com/SunnyMaolo\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://twitter.com/SunnyMaolo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">at their Twitter page</a></span>, including shots of one of their other Evangelion suits, like the one below.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"94d9c6140f5146cea8f0901aa06fdff9\" data-recommend-id=\"image://94d9c6140f5146cea8f0901aa06fdff9\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"1536\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"94d9c6140f5146cea8f0901aa06fdff9\" data-recommend-id=\"image://94d9c6140f5146cea8f0901aa06fdff9\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"1536\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>', '2024-01-10 17:47:01', '2024-01-10 17:47:01', 'Neon Genesis Evangelion Cosplay Gets In The F**king Robot', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/a367ce659c2c5ccc6d83721227bfad0f.jpg', 'cosplay', 'https://kotaku.com/neon-genesis-evangelion-cosplay-gets-in-the-fucking-rob-1848134616', 'I’ve lost count of the amount of Neon Genesis Evangelion cosplay I’ve posted on ...', ''),

It wasn’t anything serious, at least by football violence standards, as fans mostly resorted to just shouting and sticking fingers up at one another, but one notable thing about this little stoush was that a man dressed as Mario got himself arrested.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">As you can see below, amidst all the loud voices a guy dressed as Mario decides to escalate things and start throwing punches, which triggers an immediate police response as he’s hurled to the ground and detained. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">For what it’s worth, Barnsley won the game 1-0 after Coventry missed a 95th-minute penalty.</p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"5706c52d4c01ba0df59358fca26ea47b\" data-recommend-id=\"image://5706c52d4c01ba0df59358fca26ea47b\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"807\" data-height=\"1313\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"5706c52d4c01ba0df59358fca26ea47b\" data-recommend-id=\"image://5706c52d4c01ba0df59358fca26ea47b\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"807\" data-height=\"1313\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>', '2024-01-10 17:52:01', '2024-01-10 17:52:01', 'Mario Got Himself Arrested Before An English Soccer Game', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/c270b6cf72a5688ab1986878a7bd5c4c.jpg', 'cosplay', 'https://kotaku.com/mario-got-himself-arrested-before-an-english-soccer-gam-1847521550', 'The return of capacity crowds to English football stadiums has been a beautiful ...', '');

This decision was reached after every possible scenario to hold our event safely was considered. We have been working for several months on structural changes to the convention layout and operation in order to make a safe Katsucon 2021 possible. While we had every intention of moving forward with the safest possible convention under these structural changes, in the end, we and the Gaylord National Convention Center have come to the conclusion that we are unable to hold our event up to our standards per current county and state COVID regulations, making it impossible to have Katsucon in February 2021. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">While our goal is to put on the best convention possible, ultimately it is the health &amp; safety of our staff, guests, and attendees that is of the utmost concern. We know that this decision may have seemed inevitable in the face of this global pandemic, but that makes this no less heartbreaking to see a Katsucon missed for the first time in 27 years.

This is during the height of the Empire’s reign, and that’s why Kay is constantly on the run.

According to Narrative Director Navid Khavari, the team wanted<em> </em>to explore the ground-level impact of <em>Star Wars</em>’ intergalactic conflicts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">“We always knew we wanted to create an original scoundrel story,” Khavari <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-interview-ubisoft-1313-ragtag-1851118340\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-interview-ubisoft-1313-ragtag-1851118340\">told <em>Kotaku</em></a></span>. “There was something exciting about looking at [this universe] from the perspective of a scoundrel like Kay, who has no experience with the Empire, Jedi, Rebellion or the Sith.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h95370\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>How does it play?</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Star Wars: Outlaws </em>looks like a Ubisoft game in more ways than one. Yes, it has the open-world structure that’s become synonymous with the company, but it also has stealth action elements like sneaking, parkour, and stealth attacks reminiscent of the <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-assassins-creed-games-worst-to-best-1844019813/slides/4\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-assassins-creed-games-worst-to-best-1844019813/slides/4\"><em>Assassin’s Creed</em></a></span><em> </em>series. There’s also some cover shooter elements, and hand-to-hand combat, and you can manipulate the environment by sending Nix to hit switches and pick up items across the battlefield.<br></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In addition to on-foot combat, <em>Outlaws </em>has vehicle combat, too, withlast year’s Ubisoft Forward showing Kay firing her blaster while on a speeder bike, slowing down time to line up her shots.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"f3a56602c98792916b0bbb890e1cf5f3\" data-recommend-id=\"image://f3a56602c98792916b0bbb890e1cf5f3\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Kay sneaks behind containers to avoid Empire forces.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"f3a56602c98792916b0bbb890e1cf5f3\" data-recommend-id=\"image://f3a56602c98792916b0bbb890e1cf5f3\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Kay sneaks behind containers to avoid Empire forces.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Kay’s blaster seems to have different settings and modifications that change its function. The ones seen in the demonstration included a stun mode and a “focused” mode, which appear to work better on certain enemies or obstacles. The focused setting helps apply pressure on shielded enemies, allowing Kay to get in close for a melee finisher.</p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h95371\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Wanted system</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Part of being a wanted criminal is being on the run. <em>Star Wars Outlaws </em>has a reputation and wanted system similar to that in <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-rumor-leak-release-date-rockstar-1850718620\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-rumor-leak-release-date-rockstar-1850718620\"><em>Grand Theft Auto</em></a></span>, which means if you’re caught doing crimes, you might find yourself on the wrong side of an imperial blaster. Your reputation with different factions will affect how easily you can access certain areas, so while you’re bound to make some enemies on your way through space, it will be important to keep in mind who hates you the least while traveling.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h95372\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>That’s cool and all, but what about space travel?</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Kay’s adventure spans the galaxy, and she can fly around it in her Trailblazer starship. From space, she can fly to different destinations and take part in some space combat against the Empire’s forces. You can also jump to lightspeed while in space to escape Imperial forces and cool down your wanted meter.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h95373\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Dialogue choices, but not branching threads</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">As seen in the demonstration video, <em>Star Wars Outlaws </em>features dialogue choices that let you color in the lines of who Kay is.

But first, go grab at least one assault rifle (and some other goodies) off those pirates you just wasted.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94576\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Loot everything and give it to Vasco</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Speaking of looting stuff, feel free to grab everything and just dump it on the robot who partners up with you in the early hours of <em>Starfield</em>. Like in previous Bethesda games, your companions are pack mules with dialogue trees. Use ‘em! To do so, just chat with the bot (or other companions) and ask to trade items.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94577\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Use cover like a modern shooter</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Aiming near cover will have you pop out in a way that feels unlike any previous Bethesda RPG. Sure, dynamic cover like this has been around since 2012-ish, but hey, I’m not going to complain about <em>Starfield</em> having good combat compared to <em>Fallout 4</em> and <em>Skyrim</em>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94578\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Use the laser mining tool for killing</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The Cutter you get at the very beginning is deceptively great in battle. It works on a cooldown with unlimited ammo, and can stun-lock enemies at close range. Pull it out every now and again to save precious bullets early on.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94579\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Set your helmet and space suit to disappear when not needed</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Early on in the game, <em>Starfield</em> tells you to go into your menus to put on your helmet. You might be mistaken and think you have to do that every time you want to take it off or put it on. (And you need it out in space to live.) But nope! Just leave it and your suit on, then go into the inventory section for each. You’ll find an option at the bottom of the screen letting them disappear automatically when not needed, like in towns or stations. No more running around cities looking like a giant dork!</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94580\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Pump up your persuasion trait ASAP!</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If you don’t want to waste all your resources fighting through every encounter, make sure to put some points into persuasion. It will increase the odds that you can talk people down from fights and generally make it much easier to manipulate people, which is why you’re playing this game, right?</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94581\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Careful you don’t sell your equipped gear</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The game won’t check you while you’re pawning off all your loot so spam that sell button with caution.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94582\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Save time by fast-traveling directly through the quest menu</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You don’t always have to navigate through your cumbersome star chart to get to a new planet. If you want to go to the next location for a mission and you’ve already been there before, simply use the “select course” option from the pause menu to automatically head to the destination.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"c0738ff6a2adaddb9b8de30dc3730aa5\" data-recommend-id=\"image://c0738ff6a2adaddb9b8de30dc3730aa5\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"An image shows an astronaut exploring an alien world. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"c0738ff6a2adaddb9b8de30dc3730aa5\" data-recommend-id=\"image://c0738ff6a2adaddb9b8de30dc3730aa5\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"An image shows an astronaut exploring an alien world. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94583\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Scan everything all the time</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Starfield</em> basically gives you detective vision. In addition to scanning planets, your helmet sensor will also scan everything right in front of you, highlighting nearby enemies and valuable loot. This is also how you survey fauna for extra XP. Plus, you can use it to find your ship’s location on the horizon and instantly fast travel to it.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94584\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Don’t forget to take a nap</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Sleeping will fully heal you and also give you a “well-rested” bonus that increases the rate at which you earn XP.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94585\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Use the research station on your ship to get access to more craftable stuff</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You can upgrade guns, suits, and helmets as well as cook food in this game. But you’ll need to do some research first. You’ll need some materials, like iron and fiber, but once you have some you can unlock new mods and things to craft, letting you improve guns and make good suits even better.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94586\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Hitting undo while lockpicking still spends a digipick</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">So be careful, they’re hard to come by!</p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94587\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Use your ship inventory</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You don’t just have to give all of your extra items to companions or throw them on the floor, you can also store them in the ship’s cargo hold by selecting it from the ship part of the menu (bottom left). It’s not unlimited but it has more than enough room in the beginning. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94588\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Designate weapons and healing items as favorites to save time</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">As far as I can tell, in the first few hours of the game at least, <em>Starfield </em>doesn’t say anything about favoriting weapons. But you should totally do that! Like in past Bethesda games, you can map guns, medkits, knives, and more to your d-pad and then quickly switch weapons during combat without needing to open the game’s (not great) menus. Simply replace an item with something else to change up your favorites.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94589\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Look for beds when clearing out space dungeons</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Battles in <em>Starfield </em>can be tough, especially early on. And if you don’t have many medpacks to heal your wounds, you might end up in a bad situation. However, many outposts and enemy camps contain beds that you can sleep in to heal back up to full HP. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You can’t sleep in active combat so you’ll need to hide from the AI a bit if enemies are around, but that’s usually pretty easy. You can also sleep after big fights, before moving deeper into the location, so as not to waste medpacks.<br></p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94590\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Be careful with contraband</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In <em>Starfield</em> contraband items—marked with a yellow icon—are very valuable but also tricky to sell, as any time you warp into <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/starfield-faction-best-quests-crimson-fleet-reward-join-1850805835\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/starfield-faction-best-quests-crimson-fleet-reward-join-1850805835\">UC or Freestar space</a></span> you’ll be scanned for these items. And if you have some on your ship, you’ll be in a lot of trouble. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">However, you can install (or find a ship that includes) a shielded cargo hold that will let you smuggle these items around with less threat of being caught and sent to space jail.<br></p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94591\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Get drunk (or take certain chems) before trying to persuade</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">There are moments in <em>Starfield </em>where you’ll need to persuade an NPC, perhaps to get what you want or to make them change their mind. While I recommend leveling up your Persuasion skill, you can also make these moments easier by consuming chems or booze that boost your Persuasion ability for a short time.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94592\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Also, always carry some Amp on you</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Speaking of chems, always carry some Amp on you.

And it can happen easily in the early hours of the game. To avoid this, make sure you check your entire inventory for heavy items. You can do this by selecting all items in your inventory screen and then sorting everything by weight. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Keep an eye out for ship parts, which are useful on your ship, but worthless and very heavy paperweights in your character’s inventory.<br></p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94595\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Don’t ignore the main quest (seriously)</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">No story spoilers here, but trust us: Play the main questline. You don’t necessarily need to finish it right away—even if there is some cool stuff waiting for you in new game+—but definitely make progress in it. Not only are the story quests pretty good all around, but you’ll unlock some…extra things worth having. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94596\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Use your jetpack on low-grav planets to move quickly</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Once you unlock the jetpack (or the boostpack as it’s called in-game) use it! This can help speed up traversal on planets with low gravity as you can fly long distances by timing your jets properly, letting your stamina recharge in the process. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94597\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Level up lockpicking early</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If you’ve played a lot of Bethesda games, you know that being able to lockpick and hack anything can be extremely useful. And that’s the case here in <em>Starfield</em>. Even better, <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/starfield-lockpicking-digipicks-minigame-help-fun-xbox-1850797165\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/starfield-lockpicking-digipicks-minigame-help-fun-xbox-1850797165\">the digital lockpicking skill</a></span> covers <em>both </em>doors and computers. Level it up ASAP so you can unlock better loot and find easier routes during some quests. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94598\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Also, always buy lockpicks and medpacks at stores</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Another tip I’ve picked up from past Bethesda games: Always be buying lockpicks and health kits. Seriously, make it a habit to check for these items every time you arrive at a shop or meet up with a merchant.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94599\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Slap some extra cargo on your spaceship</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Being able to drop off all your resources and heavy, valuable loot at your ship is handy! However, you’ll quickly run out of room in your cargo hold if you don’t upgrade it. While there is a perk you can upgrade to improve your ship’s cargo capacity, I recommend installing more storage units on your ship. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You can do this at any port with a ship tech NPC, and it’s not very expensive. Just open up the ship builder, grab some cargo storage containers, and attach them to your starship. Now you can carry even more random junk you find during your galactic adventures.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">  <strong>Update 9/7/2023 4:05 p.m. ET: </strong>After playing more <em>Starfield, </em>we’ve added 11 more tips to this list!</p>', '2024-01-10 18:27:01', '2024-01-10 18:27:01', '28 Things I Wish I Knew Before I Started Playing Starfield', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/17abb90c9698bb10802c31de9a363c50.jpg', 'game-tips', 'https://kotaku.com/starfield-tips-guide-xbox-money-fast-travel-map-traits-1850798018', 'Starfield is finally here and it is big, complex, and often overwhelming.

You want to be supportive, curious, and competent. You’re there to have a good time, and understand going with the flow is key to harmony.

You’re not playing a game with a like-minded adult who shares your sense of purpose or your temperament. One minute you’re co-opping with a volatile, rage-quitting narcissist then a condescending, proficient genius the next. Whether this is your first time playing <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/tag/mario\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/tag/mario\">Mario</a></span> in decades or you’re a lifelong devotee, these tips are designed to help you facilitate a fun session for everyone. And for parents of little ones, we’ve got some extra tips for you, too.</p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h103223\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><em>Mario Wonder</em> Tips for Kids of All Ages</h2>\n<h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h103224\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>Don’t Be Too Goal Oriented</h3>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You can’t help being an adult. It’s hard work, and conditions you to approach life a certain way. No judgment: Being a productive, task-oriented person is what our entire education system is based on. Once you’ve gone through school and spent a few years working you have a compulsion to get shit done the right way. Kids are different.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If you’re playing alongside them and find yourself saying you’re “supposed” to do something—i.e. “you’re supposed to get those big purple coins!”—switch gears. <em>SMBW</em> is a great playground, so slow down and have fun. Seeing the game through a child’s eyes will give you a new appreciation for its incredible level design.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h103225\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>Replay Fun Courses</h3>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Sometimes a level is just a lot of fun and you can’t wait to do it again. So don’t! If your kid thinks the Hoppos are hysterical, then play the Hoppo level as long as they want. If they’re really good at the Parachute Hat Badge Challenge, let them do it again and again. The difficulty curve in <em>SMBW</em> will sneak up on you and can hit kids pretty hard. Nothing takes the fun out of a night of gaming faster than running into a level no one can beat. So avoid frustration at all costs. You can always come back and play more once the kids go to bed. There’s multiple save files for a reason.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h103226\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>Pro Controllers Are a Wise Investment</h3>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">While it’s admirable that the Switch comes with two built-in controllers, using a single Joy-Con to play games for any substantial length of time isn’t ideal. This is especially true for parents who aren’t gaming much, or those more accustomed adult-sized controllers. If this sounds like you, then consider investing in a Switch Pro Controller (<span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\"[]\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller/dp/B01NAWKYZ0?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-wonder-parents-guide-tips-kids-1850989760&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\" data-amazonasin=\"B01NAWKYZ0\" data-amazontag=\"kinjakotakulink-20\">like this one</a></span>) to make life easier. Odds are you’ll like it so much, you’ll end up getting more than one. There are also plenty of less expensive third-party alternatives, whether you prefer corded or wireless controllers.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"69ed3eaffd5dc7a4234590060fac4275\" data-recommend-id=\"image://69ed3eaffd5dc7a4234590060fac4275\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Yellow Toad fly toward the flagpole at the end of a level. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"69ed3eaffd5dc7a4234590060fac4275\" data-recommend-id=\"image://69ed3eaffd5dc7a4234590060fac4275\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Yellow Toad fly toward the flagpole at the end of a level. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h103227\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><em>Mario Wonder </em>Tips for Younger Kids<br>\n</h2>\n<h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h103228\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>Let Them Have The Crown</h3>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">On paper, the mechanic of having the player who gets the best score earn a little crown to wear seems cute and harmless. A silly little thing that has no bearing on the game and is essentially meaningless. Unless you are a small child. Then, suddenly and without warning, the crown will become the most important thing in your life. You will wail and despair if someone else has the crown, even if they get it by accident. So, parents, a word of warning. Let your kid get the crown. If you’re navigating siblings you may need to institute some hard rules on sharing, or wear the crown yourself in a “if you can’t play nicely you can’t play at all” situation. In the meantime let’s pray Nintendo lets us disable this feature in a future update.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h103229\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>No-Damage Characters Have a Catch</h3>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">One of the things that sets Nintendo apart from Sony and Microsoft is their dedication to family-friendly gaming. This comes through in a lot of places in <em>SMBW</em>, but the addition of the Yoshis and Nabbit is probably the biggest accommodation they’ve made in franchise history.

It’s simple to use and lets you create some really impressive engineering feats. However, one thing I had a lot of trouble with is rotating items as I suspended them in the air. The game only lets you rotate things on the x and y axes, but because an item stays in the same position it was in when you use Ultrahand, it can sometimes be difficult to get its position right. I struggled with this for a few hours before realizing that pressing ZL while rotating resets the item’s orientation. You may still have to rotate it a bit on the axes, but it will make that process substantially easier.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h3732\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Constructs disappear if you reload your save</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Most of us put our Switches on standby mode when we step away from a game, but if you close out <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://goto.target.com/c/379647/81938/2092?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fthe-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch%2F-%2FA-88492050%23lnk%3Dsametab\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/379647/81938/2092?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fthe-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch%2F-%2FA-88492050%23lnk%3Dsametab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a></span><em> </em>or save and reload, your Ultrahand-built constructs and their components will reset.

There are two major advantages to doing this 12-part questline that make it worth bee-lining to. First, it has a pretty good reward in the Froggy armor set. This top, pants, and headpiece give Link some slip resistance, which makes it easier to climb surfaces when it’s raining.

Once here, click the dropdown next to AppData on the search bar and go to Local. Scroll down until you see Larian Studios. Here, just delete the whole <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> folder. This will delete the saves from your hard drive, but also just let you start fresh for when you install the new game to avoid any kind of conflict within the backend.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"3b1d383cd0371317f2ed8f7c405fcea1\" data-recommend-id=\"image://3b1d383cd0371317f2ed8f7c405fcea1\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A hero is shown looking at a stained-glass window.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"3b1d383cd0371317f2ed8f7c405fcea1\" data-recommend-id=\"image://3b1d383cd0371317f2ed8f7c405fcea1\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A hero is shown looking at a stained-glass window.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h90048\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>If you’re stuck, just go somewhere else</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> can sometimes feel a bit obtuse in its quest design because it doesn’t hold your hand. Oftentimes I would run into a wall on a quest and didn’t feel like I was getting a lot of help from my journal as to what I should do next. Some of my earliest frustrations playing the RPG had me feeling like I’d lost all momentum on a questline because I couldn’t figure out the solution for something. I have a tendency to point beeline through RPG quests, and <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>has made me wrestle with those habits. It turns out that sometimes the best way to move forward is to simply go somewhere else and start another quest, rather than tunnel-visioning on one thing.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This is a good practice because it not only keeps you from getting stuck, but in several cases it can lead you to find solutions or helpful new context for quests other than the one you’re currently doing. That may be finding a new thing to do within a certain area or hub, or just learning something new about one of your party members while you’re on the other side of the world. When <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> throws walls up, turn around instead of beating your head against them. The quicker you recognize when your time is better spent elsewhere, the more you’ll actually accomplish in the world.</p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h90049\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>When traveling, just click on your destination</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This mostly just applies to anyone playing on mouse and keyboard, but one thing I quickly picked up on during my travels is that it’s better to just click on your destination rather than micromanage your character’s movement when you’re trying to cross large distances. Clicking on a destination will have your character automatically find the path to that spot rather than you having to guide their every step. However, do be careful when you do this in dangerous areas, because in my experience, your character can walk through hazards without a care for their self-preservation. Click on a spot in a volcano and they will often take the path through the lava when a less direct approach and a well-placed jump could have avoided the burns entirely. So use your discretion when taking this approach, but in places like forests, towns, and camp, just clicking on where you’re going is the most efficient way to get around.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If you’re playing with a controller on your PS5 or Xbox, you can access the point-and-click interface by pressing L3 (clicking in the left thumbstick on Xbox), which will give you a cursor to move across the map to choose your destination and have your character walk to it automatically. It might not feel as good as moving them with the analog stick, but it will let you map out your movement.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"654d612755e4178b3e9db6ada7174b6d\" data-recommend-id=\"image://654d612755e4178b3e9db6ada7174b6d\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Minthara is shown standing at the edge of a cliff.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"654d612755e4178b3e9db6ada7174b6d\" data-recommend-id=\"image://654d612755e4178b3e9db6ada7174b6d\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Minthara is shown standing at the edge of a cliff.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h90050\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Push it real good</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">One of the lowkey best tools in your arsenal in <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> is shoving enemies during fights. As a bonus action, this won’t come at the expense of your attack each turn, and it lets you push enemies a pretty respectable distance. That’s handy for helping ranged characters get some distance so they can better use their bows or spells, but it also can be a secret one-hit kill depending on the arena you’re fighting in. Shoving a character off a high point will cause them to take fall damage, and in some cases, you can send someone plummeting to their death. Characters with high strength stats are best equipped to do this, but everyone can at least try to shove an enemy before any other action, and if the dice rolls in your favor, you can send someone down a chasm. This isn’t exclusive to grunts and lower-level enemies either. I cut a fight in half by shoving a boss down a hole in the second turn, leaving me to just clean up their lackeys. I saved myself so much time and so many supplies just by leading with a shove instead of a spell. So now, every time I enter a fight I’m looking for opportunities to push an enemy to their death like I’m Gerard Butler in <em>300</em>. Using abilities like Misty Step, which lets you teleport to a different spot on the map, can be real helpful in taking advantage of an enemy’s high ground.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h90051\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>You don’t have to use long rest to see nighttime scenes</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">After a long day of getting beat up by wildlife and mind flayer lackeys, you’ll have to go back to camp to heal up. There are two options for this, the most ideal of which is called “long rest” which fully replenishes your health and spells. But doing this requires resources including food and supplies you’ve picked up on your journey. Each has a point value and if you have enough to reach 40 points, you’ll get to do a full rest. If not, you’ll do a partial rest which will only heal you up to the halfway point. This is pretty self-explanatory, but there’s an aspect to resting at camp that isn’t overtly explained: nighttime character moments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Some nights, your party members will surprise you at night with a new scene that expands upon their relationship with you, as well as with each other. But you’ll have to actually rest to see them. However, if you’re trying to see one of these events, you don’t have to long rest to start the scene. So be mindful of whether or not you need to use your supplies when you’re trying to see more story content, because you can do a simple partial rest.</p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h90052\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Flip the barter/sell toggle</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If you find yourself talking to a merchant and looking to get rid of some of the junk you’ve picked up on your travels, know that the game doesn’t default to you selling those items. Instead, it drops you into the bartering system. This means you can make a trade for some items with no monetary cost to either yourself or the merchant, but if you’re looking to get gold instead of more nonsense to carry around, you’ll need to toggle to selling your stuff instead of trading it. There’s a switch you can flip at the top of the screen, but it can be easy to miss if you just immediately start throwing junk into the barter slot with reckless abandon. So just be sure you know what you’re actually doing before you start loading up your cart.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"9aa475cbfce780e6a569d341cb4d698f\" data-recommend-id=\"image://9aa475cbfce780e6a569d341cb4d698f\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A hero and Lae\'zel are seen looking at the aftermath of a battle, including a person shot in the back with an arrow.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"9aa475cbfce780e6a569d341cb4d698f\" data-recommend-id=\"image://9aa475cbfce780e6a569d341cb4d698f\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A hero and Lae\'zel are seen looking at the aftermath of a battle, including a person shot in the back with an arrow.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h90053\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Sometimes switching your player character is the best approach</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>’s eclectic party members come from different backgrounds and have different proficiencies, and as a result, sometimes one of your companions is just better suited for a situation than your created avatar. I’m playing as a human warlock, and while he’s spec’d to excel in charisma checks, sometimes that’s not enough. Another character’s background and expertise on certain stats can make them the ideal person to take the lead on a problem. Once, I switched control to Lae’zel, the Githyanki warrior with a connection to others of her race that my human character couldn’t overcome on dice rolls alone. Other times, characters will be able to pass a perception check or a religion check that makes them better suited to do things as simple as examine an object in the world and provide context my character can’t. So if you’re missing certain checks, try swapping to another character in your party and seeing if they notice something you don’t.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h90054\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>The Attack of Opportunity is your friend and foe</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">One of the passive reaction abilities every character has is called the Attack of Opportunity. This allows you (and your foes) to automatically attack an enemy that is moving out of close-quarters attack range for free. This is something to be cognizant of for yourself, as enemies getting up in your face means guaranteed damage even on your own turns if you try to move away from them. One way to handle this is the previously mentioned Shove ability, which will push them out of Attack of Opportunity range so you’re free to move away safely. But it also can be a strategic play to position your characters close to enemies, long-ranged ones especially, so they get caught up in the area of effect. If you do this against an archer or spellcaster, odds are they will try to move away from your character out of necessity, as their accuracy goes down if they’re too close. So even if you can’t take them out in one turn, just having your character in their proximity can score you some free damage.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"9aee158785a61496bece7115890e01ed\" data-recommend-id=\"image://9aee158785a61496bece7115890e01ed\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A Baldur\'s Gate 3 dice roll shows successful stat check.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"9aee158785a61496bece7115890e01ed\" data-recommend-id=\"image://9aee158785a61496bece7115890e01ed\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A Baldur\'s Gate 3 dice roll shows successful stat check.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h90055\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Weapon efficiency is determined by the character examining it</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Something it took me a few hours to realize is that, because I was hoarding all my loot with my warlock character, I would see the prospective stats for a sword or an axe and think it wasn’t anything impressive because the numbers it showed in the menu were reflective of his stats, which don’t prioritize strength. See, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> tells you weapon stats based on the character whose inventory it’s in. If I took a sword from my character’s inventory and moved it to Lae’zel or Karlach, who are geared toward those kinds of weapons, I’d see much higher numbers because it was then taking into account those party members’ stats to give me a new, higher projected damage output. So if you’re looking to see if you should change a character’s loadout, move it to their inventory instead of someone who wouldn’t use it to begin with.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h90056\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>The word is mightier than the sword, spell, fist, etc.</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I love talking my way out of shit in RPGs, and <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>is no exception. When I made my warlock character, I spec’d hard into charisma, intimidation, deception, persuasion, and anything that would give me an edge in dialogue checks. There are so many combat scenarios I was able to circumvent with a silver tongue, and it kinda rules. The combat is great, but there’s just something so nice about talking out the ass and saving all those supplies, HP, and time, and honestly, I’ve dumped so many points into these attributes that it can kind of feel OP. I can’t think of many rolls I’ve missed on dialogue checks because I’ve pretty much ensured I’ll always have enough points at the end of each one. But for when I do need some help on that front…</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h90057\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Shadowheart’s Guidance is too good to not have at all times</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Shadowheart, the party’s resident cleric and racist, has an ability called Guidance, which gives you an additional d4 bonus to ability checks both in battle and in dialogue. In dialogue checks, this can be applied to every dice roll, which means you will always have a buff to whatever you roll with no downside. There’s zero reason for you not to use it every time a check pops up, which means Shadowheart has become a mainstay in my party. Sure, she has healing spells right out the gate and can pack a decent punch, but I keep her around so she can make my numbers go up every time. Here’s hoping she unlearns her prejudice against Githyanki, because I’m already tired of that shit.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"44fd9b5a75c4ae95b7ecbc2454979f8b\" data-recommend-id=\"image://44fd9b5a75c4ae95b7ecbc2454979f8b\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A hero and Shadowheart are seen looking at something on the ground.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"44fd9b5a75c4ae95b7ecbc2454979f8b\" data-recommend-id=\"image://44fd9b5a75c4ae95b7ecbc2454979f8b\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A hero and Shadowheart are seen looking at something on the ground.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h90058\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Destroy alarms and war drums as quickly as you can</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Alongside looking for shoving opportunities, one of the first things you should do in a combat encounter is be on the lookout for war drums or other kinds of alarms that your opponents might be able to use to bring in reinforcements. If you spot these quickly, you can destroy them at range with a well-placed arrow or long-range spell. If, on the other hand, you don’t destroy them in time, you’ll have a whole ‘nother squad headed your way in a turn or two.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h90059\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Ranged characters need high ground or they’re not going to be useful</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>is pretty upfront with how positioning, whether that be distance or elevation, is key to some attacks’ effectiveness. Sometimes a spell or arrow will still land if you’re on low ground or close to an enemy, but by default, you should be working toward getting your spellcasters and ranged fighters to high ground. These characters are typically not the tanky types you want hanging out with the brawlers on the ground floor anyway, so distance and high ground are always your friends for your ranged heroes.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h90060\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Use your Illithid abilities sparingly</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The mind-altering tadpoles in your party’s head come with a perk that lets you influence other characters with relative ease, but there are some drawbacks to using them without any kind of forethought. For one, you only get one of them a day before you do a long rest. So influencing some lowlife bandit is probably not the most economic use of this limited ability. If you want to go down this potentially dangerous path, whipping out one of your most finite resources with no regard for what it will cost is not the move.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But also, do you really want to use this dangerous weapon threatening your life? If, by using it, you become dependent on it, are you not failing in your quest to save yourself and your friends from its clutches? What if, by the end, you’ve used it so much that it easily takes over your mind and transforms you into a tentacled monster? I mean, unless you’re into that. You do you, booboo.</p>', '2024-01-10 18:27:01', '2024-01-10 18:27:01', '14 Things To Know Before Starting Baldur’s Gate 3', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/4885c80b8576e042feab770433425f1f.jpg', 'game-tips', 'https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-tips-save-file-abilities-builds-party-1850704861', '  Baldur’s Gate 3 has become a cultural phenomenon in 2023.

But in <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em>, they’re not quite as useful as they once were, because a different currency is far more effective at giving you what gold coins do.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>Check Out <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder:</em></strong><em> </em><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\"[]\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Super-Mario-Bros-TM-Wonder-Nintendo-Version/dp/B0C8VHZR14?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-wonder-gold-coins-purple-flower-shop-1850963074&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\" data-amazonasin=\"B0C8VHZR14\" data-amazontag=\"kinjakotakulink-20\">Amazon</a></span> </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">On top of being the standard collectible across the <em>Super Mario </em>franchise, gold coins give you a new life every time you pick up 100 of them. Because of this, and because traditionally, <em>Mario </em>games can get pretty damn tough at times, players have often gone out of their way to grab as many of them as possible in order to stock up on lives and never have to worry about a game over. However, in <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em>, there’s a new set of purple Flower Coins that act as a currency for shops you’ll find in the Flower Kingdom. These aren’t quite as abundant as the gold coins Mario’s been collecting for decades, but if you’re looking for lives, these are easily the more sensible option.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If you head to any of the shops you find on the overworld map, you’ll find 20 purple Flower Coins net you five lives, rather than the measly one you’ll get for collecting 100 gold coins. I wish I’d realized this early on, because I wasted some precious time using the new Elephant Mushroom powerup to sprinkle the ground with water and get a few extra gold coins from the flowers on the ground, when I should’ve been looking for Flower Coins, instead.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"84c2c376d5c3a54953ae6ca2c629cd12\" data-recommend-id=\"image://84c2c376d5c3a54953ae6ca2c629cd12\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Luigi stands facing a hidden 10-point purple coin in a hidden area.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"84c2c376d5c3a54953ae6ca2c629cd12\" data-recommend-id=\"image://84c2c376d5c3a54953ae6ca2c629cd12\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Luigi stands facing a hidden 10-point purple coin in a hidden area.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h99970\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Where are purple Flower Coins in <em>Super Mario Bros.

The most prominent are individual ones you’ll often find mixed in with gold coins or hidden in blocks you’ll need to break. But you’ll also find a few larger ones valued at 10 coins scattered throughout most levels, often hidden behind a puzzle, secret area, or a level-shifting Wonder Flower. There are typically three of these bigger coins in a stage, and if you’ve found them before, you can’t go back and get them again. But they are a high-value collectible that make it worth exploring levels to their fullest, both for completionist reasons and because they actually give you something tangible in return.</p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"209f1462610e76b5b9d5d58580d96f0f\" data-recommend-id=\"image://209f1462610e76b5b9d5d58580d96f0f\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A Wonder shop shows multiple items up for sale.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"209f1462610e76b5b9d5d58580d96f0f\" data-recommend-id=\"image://209f1462610e76b5b9d5d58580d96f0f\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A Wonder shop shows multiple items up for sale.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h99971\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>If I already have plenty of lives, what can purple Flower Coins get me?</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Lives aren’t the only things merchants sell in <em>Super Mario Bros.

It’s super quiet, so the controller would need to be, like, an inch or so from your ear. But despite it not housing an actual speaker, the Pro Controller still sings for you.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">According to Hidden Gaming Deals, Nintendo programmed the controller’s vibrations to sound like music. So while it’s not putting out an orchestral tune for you, as it might were it the PS5\'s literally all-singing DualSense, it instead ingeniously emits a facsimile of notes that give the impression of music. <em>Kotaku</em> tested this too, and can confirm that yep, DJ Mario is making bops in the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller lounge. It’s sick, especially if you can get precise with the platforming to structure a real song.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-wonder-reviews-switch-1850937230\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-wonder-reviews-switch-1850937230\"><em>Super Mario Bros.

Once you get the little city skyscraper icon with the green arrows filled in, you can fast travel to any point in that section of the map.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The system is so quick and seamless that if you’re already swinging or flying with your wingsuit your momentum will continue on in the new location.

Midtown is the most central, and worth unlocking first. Williamsburg, Downtown Queens, and Harlem are also worth prioritizing. But don’t rely on fast travel too much. <em>Spider-Man 2</em> is still at its best when you’re swinging down big boulevards and exploring the massive city for yourself.</p>', '2024-01-10 18:42:01', '2024-01-10 18:42:01', 'How To Unlock Fast Travel In Spider-Man 2', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/23787c879ea44522fc37c46ef5d76556.jpg', 'game-tips', 'https://kotaku.com/spider-man-2-how-to-unlock-fast-travel-ps5-guide-1850939716', 'Spider-Man 2’s New York city sandbox is bigger than ever, with the addition of Q...', ''),

And you should do that! We recommended improving your max health and damage output first. Fights in <em>Spider-Man 2</em> tend to be bigger and last longer than in the first game and being able to take extra hits and punch goons harder will come in handy.<br></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h101004\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Use your wingsuit!</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Swinging around New York is a blast, I get it, so why would you ever think about using your wings to glide? Well, because using the wings is also very fun! But more importantly, you can cover a lot of ground while gliding, especially if you take advantage of the various wind tunnels spread across the city. The wingsuit comes in especially handy as you’re crossing the East River or exploring the lower-rise areas of Brooklyn and Queens.<br></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h101005\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Try the 40fps mode</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Spider-Man 2</em> has a lot of visual options to tinker with, including ray-tracing and various modes. Normally for console games, your choices are 60fps or 30fps. But if you own a 120hz TV, Insomniac has included a 40fps mode that delivers a smoother presentation than 30fps, but retains all the fancy visual details and graphical settings. I played a few hours in this mode and enjoyed it.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">And if you are curious as to why 40fps works so well, but only on a 120hz display, check out this <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-why-ratchet-and-clank-rift-aparts-40fps-fidelity-mode-is-a-potential-game-changer\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-why-ratchet-and-clank-rift-aparts-40fps-fidelity-mode-is-a-potential-game-changer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Digital Foundry</em> write-up about <em>Ratchet and Clank</em>’s 40fps mode</a></span> for all the details.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"f8c7e1cad45a772e2a3ce7dd4a15e674\" data-recommend-id=\"image://f8c7e1cad45a772e2a3ce7dd4a15e674\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot shows Kraven the Hunter in Spider-Man 2. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"f8c7e1cad45a772e2a3ce7dd4a15e674\" data-recommend-id=\"image://f8c7e1cad45a772e2a3ce7dd4a15e674\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot shows Kraven the Hunter in Spider-Man 2. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h101006\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Don’t focus on side content at the start</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Look, it’s fun to swing (and glide!) around NYC. I get it. And you might be tempted to start knocking out all the side stuff or taking down random criminals across the city right from the start. Instead, we suggest focusing on the main campaign for a bit to unlock more abilities, side content, and collectibles.<br></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h101007\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>But don’t wait until the very end, either</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Lots of repeating icons throughout the map—like Sandman’s crystals and the Forgotten Flame cult break-ins—slowly build toward a narrative conclusion as you complete them. These are far more satisfying if you haven’t already completed the main story. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Catching Kraven’s drones and completing all of his hideouts are especially worth completing mid-game because they help build out his character’s backstory and motivations in more interesting ways.<br></p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h101008\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>SLINGSHOT TIME!</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The Slingshot Launch is an exhilarating new way to get some momentum quickly and cover large distances. Hold L2+X anywhere to start the slingshot move and then release to go flying into the sky. While you can do this practically anywhere, we recommend slingin’ off the top of a tall building for maximum effectiveness.<br></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h101009\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Web shooters are your friend</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s very simple. ABC: always be cobwebbing. Your web shooters can slow enemies down, temporarily disarm them, or stick them to walls. Don’t forget to keep spamming the R1 button in-between punching and web-swinging to get the most out of your web shooters.<br></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h101010\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Upgrade the web grabber gadget</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The Web Grabber is one of the best tools in the game. It ensnares groups of enemies and pulls them into a big pile, which is incredibly handy for crowd control and setting up combos. It can be upgraded to grab objects and big baddies, too, clearing whole waves of enemies in a cinch.<br></p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"b8fc9273df746aa256d9412e2b867328\" data-recommend-id=\"image://b8fc9273df746aa256d9412e2b867328\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot shows a blue glowing chest in Spider-Man 2. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"b8fc9273df746aa256d9412e2b867328\" data-recommend-id=\"image://b8fc9273df746aa256d9412e2b867328\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot shows a blue glowing chest in Spider-Man 2. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h101011\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Keep an eye (and ear) open for blue and yellow tech crates</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Dotted across the Big Apple are blue and yellow boxes that contain resources you’ll need to upgrade gadgets, suit tech and craft new costumes. Why are these boxes here? The game explains that. But regardless, if you compulsively collected every orb in <em>Crackdown</em>, this will feel very similar in a good way. To help locate these crates, listen for pinging and keep an eye out for bright blue or yellow lights on top of buildings or in alleyways. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h101012\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Spread out skill points between both Spider-Men</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">While you can usually switch between the two heroes whenever you want, there are portions of the game where this isn’t possible. Likewise, most missions and sidequests require you to use a specific Spider-Man. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">So don’t lump all your points into one. <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/spider-man-2-skills-abilities-upgrade-guide-peter-miles-1850939701\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/spider-man-2-skills-abilities-upgrade-guide-peter-miles-1850939701\">Try to upgrade both of them, as well as the shared skills</a></span>, so neither Spidey is lacking.

By the end of that game, Uncle Aaron has realized the error of his ways (after his nephew beat his ass) and turns himself in to the authorities. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If you want to see what happens next, you need to complete all the Prowler Stash puzzles in NYC.

Sure, you can ignore this mechanic at first, as early on the game throws enemies at you who don’t hit too hard and can be taken out quickly. But later on, you’ll need to parry to survive intense boss fights and bigger combat encounters.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">So instead of fumbling in the later parts as you try to master parrying, practice right away on weaker enemies and get the timing down.</p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h101017\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Give yourself a challenge and push the difficulty up to Amazing</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The game can start to get unbalanced as you begin unlocking more powers and accumulating upgrades, especially in the second half. If you’re clearing out most of the side missions before finishing the game, it’s not a bad idea to push the difficulty up to the hardest setting to keep things interesting. It’ll help to keep you from button-mashing your way to the end.<br></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h101018\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Don’t be afraid to skip puzzles or get free health in boss fights</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Spider-Man 2</em>’s accessibility options in the gameplay settings let you auto-refill your health when it hits zero and completely bypass certain puzzles in the game if they just aren’t clicking for you. If you get stuck, use them. The game’s more fun that way.<br></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h101019\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Die in boss fights to reset useful environmental traps</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Some boss fights can feature multiple stages and take quite a long time to finish. One trick that can help is if you purposely die after reaching a checkpoint in a fight. This will fill your health without using Focus bars and reset traps in the boss fight arena, which is very useful when fighting certain tougher enemies.<br></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h101020\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Tall buildings are your best friends</strong><br>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">With the new wingsuit, you can jump off New York’s tallest skyscrapers and glide for miles. Once you’ve unlocked fast travel for various parts of the city, you can immediately hop over to them, climb up, and take off to cover lots of ground quickly while looking for collectibles like Spider-Bots. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Oscorp Tower on the Upper West Side, the Avengers Tower in Midtown, and Freedom Tower in the Financial District are the best ones.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>Pre-order <em>Marvel’s</em> <em>Spider-Man 2:</em></strong><em> </em><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\"[]\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MARVELS-SPIDER-MAN-2-Launch-PlayStation-5/dp/B0C7WNMCSC/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/spider-man-2-ps5-tips-tricks-help-guide-spoiler-free-1850941904&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\" data-amazonasin=\"B0C7WNMCSC\" data-amazontag=\"kinjakotakulink-20\">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://howl.me/ckNSbfvKnwD\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://howl.me/ckNSbfvKnwD\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Fmarvels-spider-man-2-launch-edition---playstation-5%2F394826.html\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Fmarvels-spider-man-2-launch-edition---playstation-5%2F394826.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\">GameStop</a></span></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"> .<br></p>', '2024-01-10 18:47:01', '2024-01-10 18:47:01', '19 Things We Wish We Knew About Spider-Man 2 Before We Started', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/a5f75df268a6a39095335301b1d3ae8e.jpg', 'game-tips', 'https://kotaku.com/spider-man-2-ps5-tips-tricks-help-guide-spoiler-free-1850941904', 'After years of hype and numerous teasers, Spider-Man 2 is finally here.

Instead of just pulling in nearby enemies, it will also grab barrels, cinder blocks, and other throwables in the vicinity, dealing extra damage. As you progress through the game, a well-placed Grabber deployment can occasionally knock out an entire squad of enemies all by itself. All you need for this powerful upgrade is 155 Tech Parts (earned by preventing crimes) and 3 City Tokens (earned from collecting Marko’s Memories and completing Photo Ops). </p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"1e5183eb7c3ec5d0afc288405d5a949d\" data-recommend-id=\"image://1e5183eb7c3ec5d0afc288405d5a949d\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot shows the gadget menu for the Web Grabber. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"1e5183eb7c3ec5d0afc288405d5a949d\" data-recommend-id=\"image://1e5183eb7c3ec5d0afc288405d5a949d\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot shows the gadget menu for the Web Grabber. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The rest of the Web Grabber’s upgrades make it even more of a standout, increasing the range, the number of enemies pulled in, and allowing it to affect larger enemies as well. For those upgrades you’ll also need Rare Tech Parts (earned from completing Prowler Stashes and EMF Experiments) and Hero Tokens (earned from completing Hunter Bases and Mysteriums).<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">From there, it’s a good idea to focus on upgrading your standard Web-Shooters since they’re your number-one defense against enemies; you can quickly and easily subdue many mooks after just a few punches by sticking them to nearby surfaces. The first two upgrades are the most crucial, since they increase your charge count and how fast they refill.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"54590af893478af711e1b9558f99a867\" data-recommend-id=\"image://54590af893478af711e1b9558f99a867\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Peter uses the Web Grabber on enemies while wearing the black costume. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"54590af893478af711e1b9558f99a867\" data-recommend-id=\"image://54590af893478af711e1b9558f99a867\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Peter uses the Web Grabber on enemies while wearing the black costume. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Concussion Burst grenades, meanwhile, become <em>very</em> useful later on. They temporarily stun rank-and-file enemies, but are especially effective against Venom when it comes to confrontations in the back half of the game. While it’s not necessary to prioritize them right from the start, it’s a good idea to have all five of their upgrades maxed out by the third act. You’ll understand why once you get there.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The other two gadgets are frankly<em> fine</em>. It’s worth putting at least one point into upgrading the Upshot and Ricochet Web when you have the tokens to spare, but I personally didn’t find them to drastically change the odds when I got into a tight spot. Still, more toys to throw at goons equals more fun, and since <em>Spider-Man 2</em> is a game built to be 100 percented, you’ll probably find yourself upgrading them eventually anyway. </p>', '2024-01-11 06:22:01', '2024-01-11 06:22:01', 'Make Sure To Upgrade These Gadgets First In Spider-Man 2', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/26b72890c0f91c1247b37510418b2085.jpg', 'game-tips', 'https://kotaku.com/spider-man-2-gadgets-upgrade-guide-ps5-1850939665', 'Spider-Man 2 quickly gives you an overwhelming arsenal of skills and abilities t...', ''),

(134, NULL, '<p>Since its release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC last February, developer Avalanche\'s Hogwarts Legacy has continued to sell well. It has maintained the top position almost every month for best-selling games in the U.S., too. Thanks to a new interview at <em>Variety </em>with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment president David Haddad, we now know Hogwarts Legacy has surpassed 22 million copies sold and it did so in less than a year. </p>\n\n<p>Haddad told <em>Variety </em>that Hogwarts Legacy crossed the 22 million mark at the end of 2023, picking up 2 million alone in December. He says it\'s the best-selling game of the year \"in the entire industry worldwide.\" Typically, that title goes to a Call of Duty or other triple-A release. </p>\n\n<iframe allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BtyBjOW8sGY\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<p>\"But it\'s not just the unit sold that I\'m so proud of, it\'s just that it delighted the fans so much,\" Haddad tells the publication. \"It brought Harry Potter to life in a new way for gamers where they could be themselves in this world, in this story. And that\'s what the team at Avalanche set out to do when they were developing the game and I think that\'s really why it resonated so well and remains the best-selling game of the year in the entire industry worldwide.\" </p>\n\n<p>Hogwarts Legacy was also the top trending search for games on Google in 2023. While many players were likely searching for new trailers, gameplay, and guides for the game, there\'s no doubt some of the Google searching for the game stemmed from Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling\'s inflammatory statements about the trans community. Publisher Warner Bros. Interactive says Rowling was not involved with the creation of Hogwarts Legacy, which was developed by Avalanche, but given it\'s based on the Harry Potter franchise she created, she undoubtedly made money off of it.</p>\n\n<p>Elsewhere in <em>Variety\'s </em>report, Haddad touches on something Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav told shareholders during the company\'s Q3 earnings call in November of last year. During it, Zaslav said the company\'s gaming focus is on transforming its biggest franchises from largely console and PC with 3-to-4-year release schedules to include \"more always-on gameplay through live services, multi-platform, and free-to-play extensions with the goal to have more players spending more time on more platforms,\" according to <em>Variety</em>​​​​​​. </p>\n\n<p>Haddad told <em>Variety </em>that to achieve that, it needs to accumulate \"live games launched with new content, keeping our mobile games services vibrant, and large launching new content.\" Notably, Hogwarts Legacy is not a live-service game, nor does it feature any multiplayer components. It is a single-player game, and the best-selling game of 2023, according to its publisher. </p>\n\n<p>However, Warner Bros. will soon dive into the world of live-service games when Batman Arkham trilogy developer Rocksteady releases its multiplayer third-person shooter Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League on February 2. </p>\n\n<p>For more about Hogwarts Legacy and Warner Bros.\'s wider gaming plans, be sure to read <em>Variety\'s </em>full report here. </p>\n\n<hr>\n<p><i>Were you one of the 22 million people who bought Hogwarts Legacy last year?

Users can interact with apps by tapping their fingers to select, flicking their wrist to scroll, or using a virtual keyboard or dictation to type, the company says. And Apple\'s own Siri assistant can open and close apps, play media, and complete other tasks with just a users\' voice. </p>\n\n<p>Apple\'s new Persona (not that one) feature creates virtual avatars of users for use during FaceTime calls and more, and it\'s something to behold.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/08/bd16f9cf/persona.jpg\" alt=\"Apple Vision Pro VR Headset $3500 Price Launch February Release Date\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" class=\"image-style-body-default\">\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\"If a user is wearing Vision Pro on FaceTime, they appear as their Persona, while others joining from a Mac, iPad, or iPHone will appear in a tile,\" the blog reads. \"Persona is an authentic spatial representation of an Apple Vision Pro user that enables others on a call to see their facial expressions and hand movements, all in real time.\" </p>\n\n<p>The company says Persona works with third-party video-conferencing apps, too, including Zoom and Microsoft Teams. </p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the most eye-catching aspect of the Vision Pro, other than its price, is its EyeSight feature.

That comes from a new interview with the studio’s CEO, Adam Kiciński, who discusses acquisition possibilities while providing small updates on the studio’s litany of upcoming projects.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking to the Polish outlet <em>Parkiet</em>, Kiciński was asked about rumors regarding the studio being a target of a takeover. He states via translation, “We are not interested in being included in any larger entity. We have worked our whole lives to get to the position we have now. And we believe that in a few years we will be even bigger and stronger. We have ambitious plans and we are passionate about what we do. We value independence.”</p>\n\n<p>In turn, Kiciński also states CD Projekt Red is currently uninterested in buying another studio purely for the sake of having it to, in his words, “consolidate their financial results.” In October 2021, the studio acquired Molasses Flood, the developer of The Flame in the Flood and Drake Hollow. That studio is currently working on a game set in the Witcher universe codenamed “Sirius.” </p>\n\n<p>Kicińsk also provides small updates on its portfolio of upcoming Witcher and Cyberpunk games as well as its new IP. He states that work on the next mainline Witcher game, codenamed “Polaris,” is in “full swing” and has around 330 employees, which will rise to 400 by later this year. </p>\n\n<p>“Orion,” the codename for the next Cyberpunk game, has been in the conceptual stage for some time, and the development team is still being assembled. It will primarily be made from CD Projekt Red’s Boston studio and eventually expand to Vancouver, with support from the main Polish headquarters. </p>\n\n<p>Kicińsk then briefly touches on project “Hadar,” which is a new IP that is currently in the conceptual phase. When asked what Hadar is, Kicińsk simply says, “I assure you that it will be an interesting pop culture concept, fitting both The Witcher and Cyberpunk.”</p>\n\n<p>CD Projekt Red will spend 2024 chipping away at these games and is riding a wave of positive momentum following the successful launch of Cyberpunk 2077\'s Phantom Liberty expansion and other big updates the game received. Be sure to read the full interview to learn more about the studio\'s financial situation, its broader media strategy outside of video games, and its thoughts on the launch of Phantom Liberty. </p>', '2024-01-11 11:45:55', '2024-01-11 11:45:55', 'CD Projekt Red Not Interested In Being Acquired, Says CEO', 'https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/teaser_promoted_image_thumbnail_mobile_/public/2023/09/25/cdcc7097/cyberpunk2077_phantom_liberty_hell_or_high_water_pc_rgb_clean.jpeg', 'news', 'https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/01/03/cd-projekt-red-not-interested-in-being-acquired-says-ceo', 'The studio also provides small updates on its upcoming projects.', ''),

And just like when the film <em>Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey</em> took advantage of that whimsical character entering the public domain, someone has already started making a twisted, horrifying version of Mickey. In this case, it’s a video game.</p>\n\n<p>It’s called Infestation: Origins, and it’s the debut title by Nightmare Forge Games. The game is an episodic four-player co-op survival adventure in which players control exterminators tasked with killing mutated vermin – and one of them happens to be a terrifying, person-sized monster modeled after Mickey. Similar to games like Phasmophobia and Lethal Company, you’ll rely on various tools and surveillance equipment to track the source of the infestations before neutralizing them. You’ll also have to maintain power for certain pieces of equipment while evading the giant, murderous rodents.  </p>\n\n<iframe allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qe85jZhSflk\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<p>The game was announced on New Year’s Day but has already courted some controversy. It was originally titled Infestation 88 (as seen in the trailer) until it received blowback online for its perceived ties to Neo-Nazis (88 is a common dogwhistle), among other references in the trailer. Nightmare Forge Games quickly denied this and issued a statement to <em>IGN</em>  saying it was unaware of the reference and apologizing for any unintentional endorsement of Neo-Nazis, explaining the title referred to the game’s late 1980s setting. The team states:</p>\n\n<p>“We want to apologize for our ignorance on this topic and appreciate that it was brought to our attention so we could address it. There is no intentional use of Nazi symbolism in our game nor studio, and we\'ll continue to address any concerns as they arise. We strongly stand against Nazism and hate in any form.\"</p>\n\n<p>Outlets such as <em>Motherboard</em> have also pointed out red flags indicating the game could be shovelware, such as its apparent use of asset flipping (via the Unity store) and AI-generated text-to-speech voice work. “As an indie studio, we do rely on some purchased assets from the Unreal and Unity stores,” Nightmare Forge Games told <em>Motherboard</em>. “However, there is a lot of work going into this project that we’re hopeful will be evident upon release.” The developer states the AI voiceovers in particular are placeholders and plans to hire real voice actors in the future. </p>\n\n<p>Following the failure of similarly slapped together games like The Day Before, curious players should perhaps approach Infestation: Origins with some degree of caution. Infestation: Origins is coming to PC via Steam and will first launch in Early Access sometime this year.</p>', '2024-01-11 11:45:55', '2024-01-11 11:45:55', 'Someone Is Already Making A Steamboat Willie Mickey Mouse Horror Game', 'https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/teaser_promoted_image_thumbnail_mobile_/public/2024/01/03/61fcbeba/infestationorigins1.jpg', 'news', 'https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/01/03/someone-is-already-making-a-steamboat-willie-mickey-mouse-horror-game', 'That didn\'t take long.', ''),

While previous installments can be tackled as regular Mario with little problem, a fair share of the more difficult <!-- -->levels in <em>Super Mario 3D World</em> feel as if they were designed with a singular transformation in mind, and god help you if you don’t possess the requisite item. This can also be a point of frustration, but it made me appreciate the unique skills each power-up brought to the table—like Cat Mario’s climbing abilities or Boomerang Mario’s long-range item snatching—apart from simply giving Mario an extra hit before dying.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Where <em>Super Mario 3D World</em> shines is in its level design. Rather than resting on their laurels and giving players a simple collection of trope-filled <em>Mario</em> stages, the folks at Nintendo really went above and beyond in crafting levels with unique gimmicks. <!-- -->Notable high points (barring late-game levels I’m not allowed to talk about despite the game being over <!-- -->seven years old) include:</p>\n<ul data-type=\"List\" data-style=\"Bullet\" class=\"sc-1lmbno3-0 iPScqk\">\n<li>\n<span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.mariowiki.com/Shadow-Play_Alley\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.mariowiki.com/Shadow-Play_Alley\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shadow Play Alley</a></span> (2-3), which plays with perspectives in a creative way.</li>\n<li>\n<span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.mariowiki.com/Shifty_Boo_Mansion\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.mariowiki.com/Shifty_Boo_Mansion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shifty Boo Mansion</a></span> (3-3), which emulates the tricky ghost houses of <em>Super Mario World</em> with false exits, hidden traps, and secret collectibles.</li>\n<li>\n<span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.mariowiki.com/Sprawling_Savanna\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.mariowiki.com/Sprawling_Savanna\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sprawling Savanna</a></span> (5-4), which includes a huge, open area that lets Mario unleash his inner lion.</li>\n<li>\n<span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.mariowiki.com/Searchlight_Sneak\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.mariowiki.com/Searchlight_Sneak\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Searchlight Sneak</a></span> (5-7), in which Mario does his best Solid Snake impression by trying to avoid cannon-activating spotlights.</li>\n<li>And any level that features the Double Cherry, an item that clones Mario and gives you an additional character to pay attention to every time you grab one. It’s chaotic, messy fun.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The more complicated the level, however, the more the Switch struggles to keep up. Despite being a little over seven years removed from its Wii U debut, <em>Super Mario 3D World</em> still chugs and hitches when too many effects are on screen at the same time. And while the issue is fleeting during the main adventure, these framerate dips become increasingly detrimental to the experience in <em>Bowser’s Fury</em>, the bundled bonus game exclusive to the Switch re-release.</p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Super Mario 3D World + Bowser\'s Fury\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\">\n\n</section></aside>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Bowser’s Fury</em>, for those who haven’t already read my buddy Mike Fahey’s <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/i-hope-bowsers-fury-is-the-future-of-mario-1846137847\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/i-hope-bowsers-fury-is-the-future-of-mario-1846137847\">great write-up</a></span>, is essentially <em>Mario</em> by way of <em>Breath of the Wild</em>. Traditional <em>Mario</em> courses are scattered across an open-world map with no borders or loading zones, and it’s up to the player which they tackle and when. This would be pretty dang fun by itself, but you also need to keep an eye on Bowser, who for some reason has grown in size and is covered in an inky goop. Every so often, King Koopa rises from the sea like some sort of cartoon-y Godzilla, assaulting you with fireballs and laser beams until you unlock the power to grow gigantic as well. From there, it’s a matter of engaging in Power Rangers-esque battles to lull Bowser back into a fuming hibernation. Wash, rinse, repeat.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The only glaring issue is that gameplay slows to a crawl whenever Bowser makes an appearance, hampering your ability to complete levels. This turns frustrating if you don’t have enough Cat Shines to activate Mario’s superpowers, because you then either need to wait out Bowser’s tantrum or complete difficult platforming sections while he’s attacking you. Given the performance issues, <em>Bowser’s Fury</em> is the first time during the Switch’s ongoing lifespan that I’ve longed for a more powerful machine, and I hope Nintendo is close to announcing a follow-up to address these kinds of technical shortcomings with big games like the <em>Breath of the Wild</em> sequel and <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> on the way.<br></p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"rn9uzcgvdmxykduwkrlg\" data-recommend-id=\"image://rn9uzcgvdmxykduwkrlg\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"rn9uzcgvdmxykduwkrlg\" data-recommend-id=\"image://rn9uzcgvdmxykduwkrlg\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">That said, <em>Bowser’s Fury</em> is very much worth a double dip on <em>Super Mario 3D World</em>, if only for a preview of what might be the future of the <em>Mario</em> franchise. There’s something magical about its (albeit limited) free-roaming format, unshackled by constraints like demarcated levels and worlds, and I look forward to the day Nintendo decides to make a full game in the same vein.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury</em> is essentially the same game on Switch that some of you may have experienced on Wii U. While there’s no denying that the new hardware can’t keep up with the game’s ambitions at times, this bundle is at its core another fantastic <em>Mario</em> experience. Sure, it pales in comparison to the franchise’s best installments, with a limited moveset and janky camera angles often spoiling the imaginative stages and power-ups, but just like pizza, “bad” Mario is still pretty damn good. </p>', '2024-03-11 11:34:44', '2024-03-11 11:34:44', 'Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/o46l54gqfaltpopv5d1e.jpg', 'switch', 'https://kotaku.com/super-mario-3d-world-bowser-s-fury-the-kotaku-review-1846235344', 'Super Mario 3D World would be incredible if I didn’t already know who Mario was ...', '');

That’s the review.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">We could end the discussion about <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</em> right here and you’d have a pretty good understanding of the game. It has Lady Urbosa and you can play as her. She was my favorite character in 2017’s <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and she represents the one thing I love about its musou-style (hack-and-slash) prequel <em>Age of Calamity</em>. Rather than adventure through <em>Age of Calamity</em> locked in as the silent, inscrutable Link, I can venture through the story as one of <em>Breath of the Wild</em>’s more endearing and interesting characters. <em>Age of Calamity</em>’s greatest strength is its characters, especially the ill-fated Champions introduced in<em> Breath of the Wild</em>: Revali, Daruk, Mipha, and the HGIC herself (Head Gerudo In Charge) Lady Urbosa. Armed with their own unique fighting styles, weapons, and abilities, each Champion feels powerful and fun to play.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">However, <em>Age of Calamity</em>’s biggest weakness is that the game’s story does not play to that strength.<em> Breath of the Wild</em> showed us Zelda, Link, and the Champion during the time of the Calamity some 100 years before the rest of that game. Those moments were told through cutscenes. With <em>Hyrule Warriors</em>, I expected a story that delved deeper into those relationships. I wanted to see the Calamity from their perspective, hear their thoughts and feelings in their own words.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"sulbwt1w3hdsvm4umghc\" data-recommend-id=\"image://sulbwt1w3hdsvm4umghc\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"sulbwt1w3hdsvm4umghc\" data-recommend-id=\"image://sulbwt1w3hdsvm4umghc\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Instead I got a game full of meaningless missions designed for farming materials and grinding levels with a world map so bloated with “quests”—really little more than glorified grocery lists of items to assemble—that I dreaded the end of each mission, because I knew it’d only unlock more. </p>\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 cvXwRv\">\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</em> shares many similarities with its musou ancestor, 2014’s <em>Hyrule Warriors</em>. As in<em> Hyrule Warriors</em>, <em>AoC</em> (insert joke about the Congresswoman here) offers a wide cast of characters with different power levels and unique movesets. Combat is once again the kind of hack-and-slash action that involves fighting dozens of enemies at a time across chaotic battlefields. This is the blueprint of a standard musou game, as pioneered by Koei Tecmo’s developers in the <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> series. They’re the designers behind these <em>Zelda</em> spin-offs, too.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">As in any musou game, you spend most of the game mowing your way through hordes of enemies with various weapons. You execute combos with heavy and light attacks, breaking through a tougher enemy’s weak-point gauge. With the right character, fighting feels awesome—a complex dance of watching gauges fill or deplete and executing the right combos or deploying the right Sheikah powers at the right time for maximum damage. Deplete the gauge to unleash a powerful weak-point attack. Successful attacks build up your Special meter, unleashing a devastating blow that changes depending on the weapon you’re using, enemy type, and other factors. The game also rewards perfect dodges with the ability to respond with a flurry of attacks, but I found the timing window for this move to be frustratingly inconsistent.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The biggest difference with this <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> is its use of elements from <em>Breath of the Wild</em>. You can use that game’s high-tech Sheikah Slate to augment your fighting style. The cryonis rune drops blocks of ice on the battlefield that act as walls to stop a charging enemy. Stasis freezes enemies in place and sends them flying after you finish striking. Magnesis tears metal weapons out of an enemy’s hand or snatches a thrown weapon out of the air. Bombs...are bombs. They go boom. You can time Sheikah moves to counter and stun enemies. Maybe an enemy is rushing you. Trigger Cryonis to put a block of ice in his way. Let ‘em smack into it, then attack.<br><br></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">What I appreciate most about <em>Age of Calamity</em>’s combat is its dedication to making each character stand apart. Everyone can wield the Sheikah Slate but each character does so in their own unique way. Zelda’s remote bombs summon a giant, controllable Guardian to the battlefield, flinging bombs everywhere. Mipha’s bombs pour from the sky, evoking the rainfall from her home in Zora’s Domain. And Link? True to his blank-slate, silent protagonist, less-personality-than-moldy-bread character, he just chucks ‘em.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Age of Calamity</em> splits its story into chapters and allows you, for the most part, to use any character you’ve unlocked to complete story missions. You start, of course, with Link, unlocking Zelda, Impa, and the four Champions by the end of the second chapter.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Beyond those Slate differences, each character has their own unique weapon and abilities. The bird-like Revali can fight on the ground or in the air. The aquatic Mipha creates whirlwinds of water that damage enemies while healing allies. Rocky Goron hero Daruk summons clumps of hardened magma that he detonates. Lady Urbosa calls forth bolts of lightning to fry her enemies with every strike of her scimitar.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Zelda and Impa stand out as the weakest and strongest of the early characters (there are, of course, more heroes to encounter, but you’ll have to discover them for yourself). The no-nonsense rapier-wielding Zelda from <em>Hyrule Warriors </em>is gone, nerfed into a total mess of a character who’s nigh-unplayable. Nu-Zelda uses a special Sheikah Slate to fight. Her rune-focused combat style is completely unusable against boss mobs like Lynels and Hinoxes; her attacks are too slow, her hits feel incredibly underpowered, and I don’t feel like I’m making progress. I dread any battle that features Zelda as an obligatory ally, and when she’s not, she gets switched out immediately—usually for Impa.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"zea0n5c5f7tttjmxrmen\" data-recommend-id=\"image://zea0n5c5f7tttjmxrmen\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"zea0n5c5f7tttjmxrmen\" data-recommend-id=\"image://zea0n5c5f7tttjmxrmen\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If Zelda feels weak, Impa feels overpowered as hell. As I mentioned earlier, I like playing Lady Urbosa whenever I can because I simply enjoy her character, but if there’s a battle where I have to fight powerful enemies or beat a time limit, Impa is my go-to to get shit done.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Impa’s unique ability imbues her enemies with a seal that she absorbs creating copies of herself à la Naruto and his kage bunshin no jutsu. The result is a battlefield full of Impa clones that absolutely destroy everything in their path. Health bars and weak-point gauges melt away like cotton candy in rain. When fighting with a full party of Impas, her special gauge fully charges almost as soon as it depletes, allowing you to chain specials one after the other to make short work of the game’s most powerful enemies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Impa was my favorite character in <em>Hyrule Warriors</em>. I was initially dismayed to see her new design in <em>Age of Calamity</em>, concerned that she had lost the serious, badass edge in order to be Zelda’s tag-along. Though her tone and personality is indeed wildly different, she is as fun to play in <em>Age of Calamity</em> as she was in <em>Hyrule Warriors</em>.</p>\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 cvXwRv\">\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Fans of previous <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> games will lament the loss of the Adventure mode, which had you fight different types of themed battles to unlock new weapons and characters while uncovering tiles on a map that looked just like the overworld map in the original <em>Legend of Zelda</em>. Replacing it in <em>Age of Calamity</em> is the quest/challenge system.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Challenges are special battles you can fight that have different requirements. For example one challenge has you fight with a restrictive time limit encouraging you to pick your fastest, most powerful characters, while another challenge automatically fails if you take a single hit. These reward you with items that you then use to complete quests. Certain items or materials can also be purchased from shops or won by defeating monsters. Quest rewards include increased combos or life-hearts for certain characters, recipes for meals that confer some temporary in-combat advantage, a new shop, or some other boon.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"ns0zgwojxiusrmne7rim\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ns0zgwojxiusrmne7rim\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"ns0zgwojxiusrmne7rim\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ns0zgwojxiusrmne7rim\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Quests and challenges feed into a progression system. The world map is divided into the different regions of Hyrule (Lanayru, Hebra, Gerudo, etc.) with each region assigned a percentage. Each quest you do in a certain area ticks up the percentage and at certain percentage points you’re rewarded with a fat cache of materials used to—you guessed it—complete more quests.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Y’all, I <em>hate</em> quests.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">There are too damn many of them, all of them tedious. When you’re not progressing the story, you’re staring at the 50 million icons on the world map, paralyzed with the choice of which quest to do next. I’d love to show you exactly what I mean but unfortunately Nintendo’s embargo prevents me from showing a picture of how ugly and egregious this system is. Trust me when I say that looking at the full map zoomed-out is enough to induce eye strain. It’s considerably worse than even the icon-cluttered maps of open-world Ubisoft games, and that’s saying something.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">When you finish a story mission, the map lights up with new quests and challenges that ding as each one gets added. I hate that aspect the most. You’re held hostage, unable to jump into the next activity, forced to watch each new quest appear with its little ding, often in handfuls of 10 or more at such a slow pace it feels like torture. I literally groaned watching new icons light up across the screen, often stacked damn near on top of each other.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The quest/challenge system becomes a recursive loop of awful that significantly pads the game’s runtime. In order to complete the quests, you have to complete challenges. Often you are not rewarded with enough of the specific item you need, so you have to run the challenge again. I completed the main story in nine hours but I’ve clocked a total of 36 hours—and that’s with only an average 25% completion in each of the seven regions. If you’re looking for a timesink, <em>AoC</em> has you covered.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"ij2xnkddgbsakwmuxc0n\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ij2xnkddgbsakwmuxc0n\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"ij2xnkddgbsakwmuxc0n\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ij2xnkddgbsakwmuxc0n\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I’d hate this system much less if completion rate was only tied to completing challenges, as it was in <em>Hyrule Warriors</em>’ Adventure mode. Challenges serve a purpose: You can grind levels or test out new combos or unlocked characters. They also drip-feed you tiny bits of story. But quests feel like they add nothing substantial to the game. Yes, you’ll earn ostensibly useful things, but there are so many, and so few that stand out, that they start to feel like little more than an endless series of boxes to tick as you chase the next dopamine hit that’ll come from watching completion percentages increase.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The incredible quest bloat actually impeded my enjoyment of <em>AoC</em> as a musou game. This is one case where less would have been more.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 cvXwRv\">\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Despite my disdain for the system that gives structure to most of the game, <em>AoC</em> doesn’t lack for charm. It’s just that the game’s more charming moments are buried in the tiniest details, and easily missed. Characters use paragliders to jump off the Sheikah tower when it’s time to go on to the next story mission. If Link is wearing a certain piece of headgear (which I won’t spoil), his paraglider turns into a cucco. There are Koroks to find hidden on the battlefield, often requiring you to explore where there are no enemies or outposts. There are even buried treasure chests to pluck out of the ground, <em>BotW</em>-style.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Piloting the Divine Beasts was the one moment that made me sit up and go “Cool!”. In <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, the Beasts are little more than puzzle dungeons meant to test your skills wielding the Sheikah Slate. In <em>Age of Calamity</em> you experience them according to their purpose: to blow up a lot of shit. The Divine Beasts, present as a part of a larger story mission or in their own specific challenges, work like a vehicle mini-game. If you’re familiar with <em>World of Warcraft</em>, piloting a Divine Beast feels a lot like the MMO’s bombing missions—except the controls are much, <em>much</em> worse.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">There is an option to aim with motion controls. Turn that off immediately, it’s bad and fighting with it lead me to a lot of failed missions. Hell, even aiming manually led me to a lot of failed missions because for some reason the camera remains super-sensitive. (The camera is bad even outside of the Divine Beast segments. It frequently zooms into walls and at such angles that your character disappears, making it impossible to see what you’re hitting and where attacks are coming from.) Trying to aim your weapons at bases is nigh impossible when your view’s flying all over the place. I had to restart a mission more than once because I couldn’t aim well enough to shoot enough enemies within the time limit.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Divine Beasts are extremely difficult to move, as I guess an ancient massive weapon of mass destruction should be, and though they are different on paper, they each control much the same, with the same weapon types. They all have a primary-fire canon, a wider area-type attack, some kind of defensive shield, and a special that’s just a big laser. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"w5kmcx6zgvjs1frt3mll\" data-recommend-id=\"image://w5kmcx6zgvjs1frt3mll\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"w5kmcx6zgvjs1frt3mll\" data-recommend-id=\"image://w5kmcx6zgvjs1frt3mll\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Vah Medoh, the flying Divine Beast, has the worst controls. Vah Ruta (water) and Vah Rudania (fire) are in the middle, and it should come to no surprise that my favorite Divine Beast is the one Lady Urbosa pilots, Vah Naboris (lightning). Thankfully, it has the most responsive controls by far.<br></p>\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 cvXwRv\">\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The promise of <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</em> is stated right there in its name. It appeals to <em>Zelda</em> lore enthusiasts, like me, who wish to see the story of the Calamity as it happens. It’s designed to attract <em>Breath of the Wild</em> players who were enamored with the champions of the past, whose voices we only heard in unsatisfyingly small doses as spirits or flashbacks.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It pains me to say that <em>Age of Calamity</em> fails to live up to this promise. Story missions progress the plot but offer little new information that <em>Breath of the Wild</em> didn’t already cover—particularly in the <em>Champions’ Ballad</em> DLC. We recruit the champions to pilot the Divine Beasts. That’s about it. Beyond procedurally telling the story of the Calamity battle by battle, the story simply recounts Zelda’s quest to overcome her insecurity and develop her sealing powers—a tale we already heard in <em>Breath of the Wild</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, the champions think highly of Link and Zelda, affording them deep love and respect that persists in death. I was hoping <em>Age of Calamity</em> would show me how they earned that love and respect, but it seems to just appear fully formed and unearned. Everyone loves and wants to protect Zelda the minute they meet her because she’s the macguffin princess with a yet-to-manifest power to save the day. (Urbosa, of course, with her love affa—I mean, <em>history</em> with Zelda’s mother is the exception.)</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Link, on the other hand, is just there and everybody’s cool with it. Like “sure, weird boy who speaks in only grunts, you can come along too.” This goes doubly for Mipha, who apparently has loved him forever for no reason the game ever shows. Mipha, queen, you can do better.</p>\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 cvXwRv\">\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I enjoy musou games. To me, they’re like a summer popcorn action movie distilled into video game form—flashy as hell with thin plots designed to only let you watch shit explode or, in this case, beat the shit out of mobs of enemies while your kill counter reaches ludicrously high numbers. <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</em> fulfills that purpose of a musou; were it not for the egregiously bloated quest system, I’d even call the game adequate. Characters offer fun and different ways to fight, and combat capably marries the hack-and-slash style of a musou with the magic, dodging, and Sheikah Slate gameplay of <em>Breath of the Wild</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Battles do get tedious toward the end, and one in particular changed my feelings about the game from mild disappointment to active depression...but embargoes prevent me from saying when and why. Still, musou fans absolutely dying—let me be clear, you should be on the verge of literal death from a disease for which the only cure is playing a new musou game—for another fix<em> </em>can fill their time with this while they continue their vigil for a North American release of <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/persona-5-s-isnt-a-switch-port-its-persona-5-scramble-1834296331\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/persona-5-s-isnt-a-switch-port-its-persona-5-scramble-1834296331\"><em>Persona 5 Scramble: The Phantom Strikers</em></a></span>.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But part of the appeal of <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</em> was that it could be more than an action-heavy, plot-thin musou game. Maybe it’s strange to expect significant plot to happen in a spin-off rather than a direct sequel but hell, <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> did it for decades. Besides, the story of the Calamity wouldn’t necessarily advance the story of <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, just fill in gaps in our understanding of characters and relationships.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Fans primarily looking for a meaningful addition to <em>Breath of the Wild</em>’s canon can skip this game. It wastes the opportunity to establish the deep connections present in <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, instead serving only as a vehicle for beating up bokoblins as your <em>Breath of the Wild</em> fave. In the absence of other payoffs—for example, I’d forgive every sin named here if, as is typical for the <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> franchise, each character got their own story mode—not even my ardent love for these characters was enough to sustain my interest over the entire, artificially padded game. Again, you can play as Lady Urbosa. That’s it.

A real-life <em>Mario Kart</em>? “Holy shit, that’s cool!” But that glee soured quickly as my 12-year-old inner Ash gave way to the cynicism of 32-year-old adult Ash. Could <em>Mario Kart Live</em> deliver more than a couple days’ amusement before I abandoned it to the dust bunnies, as I had <em>Ring Fit Adventure</em> before it? Even as I opened its box I knew in my heart that within a month the car would end up mouldering in my closet. But I found that, as with <em>Ring Fit</em>, its novelty and amusement would be worth the space I’d have to surrender to keep it. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">  <em>Mario Kart Live</em> is fun. Flying through checkpoints and hurling bombs at Koopalings while a little plastic car raced through my living room jolted my brain with sorely needed serotonin. It’s the perfect Nintendo novelty, engineered to appeal to children but cool enough for adults like me to enjoy. It is well worth both its $99 price tag and the permanent spot in the closet it will inevitably take when, like most Nintendo novelties, its initial luster fades. </p>\n\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 cvXwRv\">\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"nfezlovulc8d70odynww\" data-recommend-id=\"image://nfezlovulc8d70odynww\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"nfezlovulc8d70odynww\" data-recommend-id=\"image://nfezlovulc8d70odynww\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit</em> is the love child of radio-controlled (RC) car racing and Nintendo’s popular <em>Mario Kart</em> video games. The package includes one car, a charging cable, four cardboard gates, and two cardboard arrow bumpers. The actual game software is free, downloadable from the Nintendo eShop.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Like most millennials, I don’t have a house—only a one-bedroom apartment in which the only hard floors are in the too-small bathroom, and the even-smaller kitchen. To test how the car performs in different spaces and on different surfaces, I played in my apartment, my partner’s two-bedroom apartment, and my father’s much-larger house that has tile, carpet, and hardwood flooring all on the same level.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The kart itself is a cute, toy car with a camera mounted right behind the plastic Mario driver figurine. My first thought taking the kart out of the box and examining its tiny, hollow rubber wheels was, “there is no way this works on carpet.” Upon throwing it to the mercy of my apartment’s wall-to-wall, I expected it to chug and struggle before spinning out after a few feet, like a real car might in mud or snow.<br></p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"vnbgnw83iuenrljllcns\" data-recommend-id=\"image://vnbgnw83iuenrljllcns\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"4624\" data-height=\"3468\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"vnbgnw83iuenrljllcns\" data-recommend-id=\"image://vnbgnw83iuenrljllcns\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"4624\" data-height=\"3468\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I was surprised, then, to see the kart zipping through my living room unbothered by the medium pile. Perhaps Nintendo deeply considered the renting segment of its playerbase, as my limited space wasn’t too much of an issue either. It was easy to create a simple track encircling my coffee table and couch, and I had just as much fun looping my living room as I did the more elaborate tracks I’d later create at my father’s house. However, the car (especially at lower cc ratings) did tend to get stuck on things like throw rugs or on the metal plate between two floor surfaces.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The car is rear-wheel drive only, so when creating your track, ensure it’s traveling downward over such seams, rather than up and over. If you have to drive into a seam, bridging it with a thin piece of cardboard can help.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">When driving, your Switch screen shows you the view through the camera mounted just behind the steering wheel. In real life, a plastic, motionless Mario figurine occupies the driver’s seat, while on the Switch you see a lively, animated Mario just as in a traditional<em> Mario Kart </em>game. He holds and throws items, he flails about when hit with one, and he even turns around to face you when you put the kart into reverse. The simple UI consists of two bars that monitor your connection and the car’s battery life. There’s also a Steer Assist option that will turn the car for you as you hold down the accelerate button. It seems perfect for younger children who may lack the motor skills (heh) to steer the car, but it’s not very good at detecting obstacles, so expect to crash a lot.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"trz8fputlh0o3cumd8uz\" data-recommend-id=\"image://trz8fputlh0o3cumd8uz\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"907\" data-height=\"510\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"trz8fputlh0o3cumd8uz\" data-recommend-id=\"image://trz8fputlh0o3cumd8uz\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"907\" data-height=\"510\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">[Note: I don’t have a capture card and native screenshotting and video capture are disabled in the game. The specifics of Nintendo’s embargo also prevent me from showing you any zoomed-in, game-only pictures or video. To get some of the images and gifs you see below, I had to tape my webcam to my shoulder in order to record video of myself that was compliant with Nintendo’s requests. Hooray creative journalism!]</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The game recommends keeping the kart within 16 feet of the Switch lest you suffer connectivity issues. Large objects like walls or a TV can also degrade connectivity. At my partner’s house, his Switch dock sits behind his 55-inch TV. When I played docked, though the kart was within the recommended distance, the large TV in the way made the camera view choppy.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The kart’s camera is also a bit finicky, and works best in just the right amount of light—what that amount of light is can vary. Too much or too little and the camera won’t be able to recognize the gates, and therefore will not recognize when you go under one. For example, my patio door faces south, and on a sunny afternoon the sun moved just enough from when I first set up the course that the new angle of sunlight was enough to impair the camera’s ability to register a gate. Though the game is flexible enough to not require the car to pass under every gate to complete a lap, too many unrecognizable gates can leave you racing in an endless loop.</p>\n\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Needing to avoid too much light means that outdoor play is a no-go, which is unfortunate. Having the option to play on a driveway or patio <!-- --> would open up the game to folks without the requisite indoor space.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">[<strong>Correction 2:54 p.m.</strong>: <!-- -->A previous version of this article stated the game requires a W<!-- -->i-F<!-- -->i connection. <!-- -->Nintendo explained in a message that the kart uses wireless to connect to your Switch, similar to the Switch’s controllers, rather than connecting directly to your Wi-F<!-- -->i. Nintendo recommends you keep your Switch within 15 feet of the kart.]</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">To get started, you pair the kart with your Nintendo Switch—a relatively simple process that involves scanning a QR code with the kart’s camera. Then you can jump straight to driving the kart around your home in Explore Mode, or create a track that allows you to play one of the game’s three racing modes: Grand Prix, Time Trial, or Custom Race. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Creating a track is simple. Place the four gates in any configuration you like; when you’re finished, Lakitu appears and splashes paint on your wheels. Then just drive through the course and the paint will create the track you play on, which you can use in any of the three racing modes.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You control the kart with the left stick, accelerate with the A button, reverse or brake with B, and use items with L. Surprisingly, you can drift in this game too. R initiates a drift, causing the on-screen kart to hop just like in a traditional <em>Mario Kart</em>. Sadly the real-world kart doesn’t hop, but drifting well on-screen can translate to an observable speed boost.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"gn3rktcj4od9npclvibu\" data-recommend-id=\"image://gn3rktcj4od9npclvibu\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"gn3rktcj4od9npclvibu\" data-recommend-id=\"image://gn3rktcj4od9npclvibu\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Grand Prix is your traditional <em>Mario Kart </em>experience. Pick a cc rating and a cup and you’ll race against digital Koopalings on a series of three tracks, earning cosmetic-unlocking coins based on how well you finish. The Koopalings are frustrating playmates. They rubberband like crazy, sometimes stopping mid-race waiting for you to catch up, and their AI knows just the right moment to deploy a shell or a banana peel to thwart you. There was also a weird situation in which the on-screen boundaries of the course would drift during the race, which made them pass through walls or other obstacles. The Koopalings, being virtual, still followed the shifted course through my real-life walls. This let them post shorter lap times than me, a human who is unfortunately still bound to the laws of the material plane.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Mario Kart</em> enthusiasts will recognize some tracks from the traditional games—both Bowser’s Castle and Rainbow Road make appearances—while others are wholly new tracks created just for <em>Mario Kart Live</em>. The tracks end up being a mix of the course you created combined with track-specific augmented-reality details that give each its unique feel. For example, in Cheep Cheep Reef, cheep cheeps swim across the track, creating obstacles you must avoid. In Bowser’s Castle, fire bars swing down from the gates, burning and stopping your kart if you fail to evade them.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"khct6dcfnuxk9dokcd1i\" data-recommend-id=\"image://khct6dcfnuxk9dokcd1i\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"khct6dcfnuxk9dokcd1i\" data-recommend-id=\"image://khct6dcfnuxk9dokcd1i\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Time Trial is a solo mode in which you race against the clock and yourself to see if you can beat your own best time. And Custom Race lets you dress your course up as a full-fledged track complete with customized gates, weather, music, and hazards, then race against the Koopalings to see who can finish fastest. (Note, however, that the game offers no way to save your custom tracks, so enjoy them in the moment.)</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">There’s also a multiplayer feature that I couldn’t experience, since Nintendo only provided one kart for review. <em>Mario Kart</em> is traditionally at its best when playing with others, so I was surprised there’s no one-kart co-op mode. Nintendo has a solid track record of finding ways to make multiplayer experiences out of traditionally single-player games, as in <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. I was hoping for something like a mode where a second player could control a Koopaling, or perhaps let them make the first player’s race more difficult by introducing hazards like lava or the mirror mode, which flips your vision and controls. As it is, to experience multiplayer you’ll have to shell out another $100 for an additional kart, or settle for passing the Switch back and forth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Item boxes function just as they do in standard <em>Mario Kart</em> games. Bloopers squirt ink all over your screen obscuring your vision, mushrooms make you go faster, and the dreaded blue shell will home in to destroy your hopes and dreams mere inches from a first-place finish. It’s neat to see how the power-ups affect your real-life vehicle’s velocity. Shell hits stop it dead, while speed-enhancing power-ups really send it flying.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"oe0pr2i9nq34xq4fdjt4\" data-recommend-id=\"image://oe0pr2i9nq34xq4fdjt4\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"4619\" data-height=\"2601\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"oe0pr2i9nq34xq4fdjt4\" data-recommend-id=\"image://oe0pr2i9nq34xq4fdjt4\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"4619\" data-height=\"2601\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The perception of speed is one of the coolest things about playing <em>Mario Kart Live</em>. At 50cc the kart barely putters along, yet your view through the Switch feels rather thrilling. Flying between table legs and past your wilting houseplants makes it feel you’re in a Formula One race for ants. At 200cc the game is nearly unplayable, as the actual kart is moving so fast that travelling over every little bump in the not-perfectly-smooth carpet makes the camera shake so much it’s hard to see where you’re going.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The game’s sound design creates a placebo effect of speed, too. You can hear the engine revving—through the Switch’s speakers only—as you hold down the acceleration button, and it shifts gears just as a “real” <em>Mario Kart </em>engine would. I could feel myself tensing, holding down the acceleration button harder as though the force of my press could make me go faster, feeling like every shifted gear actually contributed to my increasing speed. Keep your eyes on the road, though, as whenever I’d look up to confirm if I was really going as fast as I thought I was, I’d crash into a wall.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Prepare, also, for all your insecurities about your home’s cleanliness to be laid bare for you to obsess over long after you put the game away. Though the camera isn’t as powerful as a smartphone’s, it’s good enough to show you all the dust on your baseboards and just how filthy your kitchen floor is. The car’s low profile also makes it short enough to get to hard-to-reach, often-neglected places. When exploring under my bed, I found a long-lost earring and one of my dog’s toys, a tennis ball he must have lost when an enthusiastic nudge rolled it out of his reach.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"ph0zirkrlrfv6mqfczzm\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ph0zirkrlrfv6mqfczzm\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"800\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"ph0zirkrlrfv6mqfczzm\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ph0zirkrlrfv6mqfczzm\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"800\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Another question I had when testing <em>Mario Kart Live</em> was how my Welsh Corgi Ein (yeah, yeah I’m a weeb) and my partner’s cat Gus would react. I’ll let them tell it.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Ein: “I fucking hate it. I hate it so much. Goddamn, I hate this thing. You know, I’m typically a chill dog. I don’t bother anybody, I hardly even bark. All I ask for is the occasional scritch, a few treats now and then, and to be left alone when it’s nap time. Then this...<em>thing</em> comes along and disrupts my entire flow. It’s moving everywhere, rolling over my toys (RIP Mr. Squirrel) and taking over my living room, making such a racket I can’t even enjoy my daily 20-hour nap. And you know what the sick thing is, I think…I think my mother is somehow controlling that thing…and that she <em>enjoys</em> it. I step into the room and that thing is on me in no time flat, chasing me around as she laughs and laughs. I was right fuckin’ pissed. Despite the harassment I made it a point to get in there a couple of times and lay right in the middle of everything to show her I meant business.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Gus: “I agree, fuck that demon-thing. It’s bad enough that this woman regularly violates my home to usurp valuable time with my human, but now she brings that...monstrosity with her too. I’ll admit, at first I was intrigued enough that I didn’t immediately run and hide like I do with every new thing (I’m a skittish cat, what can I say). I’d examine it cautiously, retreating to a safe distance whenever it got close, and observe from the safety of a box whenever the thing tore around in loops. It seemed interesting, a toy that moved without me hitting it. But then shit turned dark. Dinnertime arrived..and she kept playing.”</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"ugea8x4htuxe7hfxpk8g\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ugea8x4htuxe7hfxpk8g\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3468\" data-height=\"2372\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"ugea8x4htuxe7hfxpk8g\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ugea8x4htuxe7hfxpk8g\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3468\" data-height=\"2372\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Ein: “No!

For a little while, anyway.”</p>\n\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 cvXwRv\">\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit</em> is the natural extension of Nintendo’s penchant for unique peripherals, from the Zapper and Power Pad of the ‘80s to the Wii’s endless assortment of plastic junk (for which the planet may never forgive us). A couple years ago Nintendo smartened up with the more environmentally friendly cardboard Labo kits, which enjoyed only passing popularity. My pet conspiracy theory is that someone in the c-suite has stock in a cardboard company, and created <em>Mario Kart Live</em>, with its cardboard accessories, to offload the excess now that <em>Labo</em>-mania has dried up. Open your third eye and see!<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"gpcuits9yg7cha8qj2pu\" data-recommend-id=\"image://gpcuits9yg7cha8qj2pu\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"800\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"gpcuits9yg7cha8qj2pu\" data-recommend-id=\"image://gpcuits9yg7cha8qj2pu\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"800\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I have a feeling <em>Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit </em>will end up just like Labo—a hot item at launch, and genuinely fun to play, but lacking enough replayability to exhibit true staying power. I truly enjoyed my weekend with the car, but toward the end I started to feel fatigued. It seems likely <em>Mario Kart Live</em> will end up one of those games that’s really fun at first blush, but eventually gets put away semi-permanently, only to be pulled out for company or special occasions. Unlockable cosmetics offer a goal to chase, but even then I can only loop my living room so many times before the chore of rearranging my space outweighs the gameplay’s novelty. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This game is really for my 12-year-old nephew. He loves <em>Lego</em> and <em>Minecraft</em> and is a natural tinkerer, and would rise to the challenge of creating different courses in a limited, largely immutable space. That’s not to say an adult couldn’t also experiment, and I expect social media at Christmastime will be flooded with images of truly wacky course design. If you have a suitable space for it, and can tap into the latent power of your imagination, then <em>Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit</em> will enjoy a decently long life in your household. Or, if you’re like me, someone whose creativity has been worn thin by the realities of being a bill-paying adult, the kart alone will deliver plenty of fun just from chasing around your pets.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Additional reporting by Ein the Dog and Gus the Cat.</em></p>', '2024-03-11 11:34:44', '2024-03-11 11:34:44', 'Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/g26uvbd4czfvinjjqnft.jpg', 'switch', 'https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-live-home-circuit-the-kotaku-review-1845365233', ' I experienced legit childlike glee upon first laying eyes on Mario Kart Live: H...', '');

As soon as I could hold a controller I was transfixed, especially when jumping. Unlike in <em>Castlevania</em> or <em>Street Fighter</em>, jumping as Mario was dynamic. You could tap the button for short hops or hold it for extra oomph. You could even move back and forth while airborne. It was a revelation. <em>Super Mario World</em> was my original “play forever” game long before <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> or <em>The Elder Scrolls</em> hit the scene.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\"><em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em>, launching this Friday, is a collection of <em>Mario</em> games that chart the series’ transition to (and dominance of) 3D platforming. With this collection, <em>Super Mario 64</em>, <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em>, and <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> have all been ported to the Switch in high definition, allowing me to examine them side-by-side for the first time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">My biggest goal with <em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em>—apart from writing the review you’re now reading—was to finally play and complete 1996’s <em>Super Mario 64</em>. 3D platforming was in its infancy then, and many looked to Nintendo’s seminal release as a blueprint for gaming’s future. Having grown up playing <em>Mario</em> games with my family, <em>Super Mario 64</em> always intrigued me. But I never got to experience it first-hand due to our lacking a Nintendo 64. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">As a result, I experienced <em>Super Mario 64</em> divorced from its historical significance. My modern perspective screamed at its numerous frustrations, like the antagonistic camera and slippery physics. Early on, I was even ready to write off this classic as a dud that didn’t hold up.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">But as I spent more time with the game—and switched from Joy-Cons to a Pro Controller—I couldn’t help but be charmed by its depth. I didn’t always have fun with <em>Super Mario 64</em>, but I grew to appreciate the ways in which Shigeru Miyamoto’s pioneering team tackled the many problems of platforming in 3D space.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">With the addition of a Z-axis came more acrobatic techniques for the portly plumber. While the basic jump still plays a huge role, Mario can also long jump, wall jump, back flip, dive, and more. I was surprised by the various moves’ utility; I quickly learned, for example, that kicking during a jump could both gain speed and act as a mid-air brake of sorts, depending on the circumstances. Areas that at first seemed impossibly challenging eventually became fun obstacle courses in which to test Mario’s various abilities.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Don’t get me wrong, levels like Shifting Sand Land and Tick Tock Clock are still <em>complete</em> bullshit, but the exasperation I felt mostly gave way to determination.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">As for how <em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em>’ port performs, I can’t really complain. The jump to Switch hasn’t introduced any obviously unfortunate consequences. In fact, while it still runs around 30 frames per second, the original’s occasional performance dips have been eliminated, and its control scheme translates well to modern controllers. If only that were the case for <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em>.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\"><em>Sunshine</em>, released in 2002 for the GameCube, is the odd duck of the <em>Mario</em> canon. Rather than forcing players to rely on Mario’s inherent vaulting skills, it provides training wheels in the form of F.L.U.D.D., a multipurpose jetpack powered by water. While a fun twist on the <em>Mario</em> formula, it also has the downside of sanding down the challenging edges.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Some of the most enjoyable moments in <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em> come when it forces Mario to navigate obstacle courses unaided, using only his jumping abilities. Even so, I get nostalgic for <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em> in the same way Nintendo 64 kids look back on <em>Super Mario 64</em> as a defining moment in the series because, well, it’s the one I grew up playing.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\"><em>Sunshine</em> is the story of a vacation gone awry, with Mario framed for several incidents of graffiti and general mess-making across the luxurious Isle Delfino. He’s jailed—a rather distressing sequence for a <em>Mario</em> game—and subsequently tasked with cleaning up the vandalized island. And much in the same way <em>Super Mario Bros. 2</em> introduced a slew of odd but enduring new enemies (e.g. Bob-ombs, Shy Guys, and Birdo), Isle Delfino’s native Piantas and Nokis have gone on to make charming appearances in subsequent games.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">In any case, <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em> was the most exciting part of <em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em> for me. Being able to revisit areas like Pinna Park and Hotel Delfino with higher-resolution visuals felt like a dream come true. Unfortunately, the drastic differences between the GameCube and Switch controllers threw a wrench into my enjoyment at times.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">The original version of <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em> took full advantage of the GameCube controller’s wonderful analog triggers. Those lovely feeling, pressure-sensitive inputs provided an amazing amount of control over Mario’s water gun. You could pull the trigger just a bit for a short dribble or click it all the way in to go full-on turret mode. In the Shadow Mario chase sequences the triggers had a very obvious sweet spot that made these encounters a breeze, letting Mario trail his doppelgänger at a safe distance while continuously dousing him. That muscle memory is what makes these encounters so frustrating in the Switch port.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\"><em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em>’ solution to this problem is pretty smart on paper. The right bumper now lets you stand in place and shoot with precision aiming, while the right trigger is akin to pulling the GameCube’s analog trigger to about the three-quarters mark. That overshoots the sweet spot, making it far less useful in practice, especially when it comes to those Shadow Mario showdowns. As the trigger is the only way to run and shoot, you have to rely on its slightly-too-far stream of water to damage the enemy, with no way to subtly adjust for his changing position. This diminished control scheme doesn’t make the encounters impossible, but it’s sure to ruffle the feathers of <em>Sunshine</em> veterans.</p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Super Mario 3D All-Stars\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\">\n\n</section></aside>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Also perplexing were frequent bouts of slowdown. I recall the original <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em> running smoothly no matter how many characters were on screen or how much water I’d spray. But in the <em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em> port, several trips back to the main hub late in the game are plagued with stuttering, as if the Switch is struggling to keep up with visuals that, apart from the resolution upgrade, were handled just fine by the 19-year-old GameCube. Again, this small inconvenience doesn’t ruin the experience, but it does commit the cardinal sin of video game ports: reminding you that it’s a port.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">The last of the trio, <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>, arrived at a time in my life that’s mostly a blur, so I don’t have a reliable memory of its intricacies. I recall being impressed by the setting—I really liked jumping back and forth between tiny worlds like some sort of Italian elder god—but other than that, my biggest memory of <em>Galaxy</em> is intensely disliking the motion controls, which were all too common on Nintendo’s waggle-happy home console and that still hold the Switch port back somewhat.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">While it brought back <em>Super Mario 64</em>’s long jump, <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> is still a wholly different, simpler beast. And unlike <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, there is little hidden depth in <em>Galaxy</em>. What you see is mostly what you get. Which is fine! This is a <em>Mario</em> game, after all, the perfect way to take a break from that latest run through <em>Dark Souls</em> or the copious maps and menus of <em>Crusader Kings III</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Whatever challenge the game held on the Wii came largely from motion controls that were mostly reliable but never <em>felt</em> reliable. It always seemed like the game’s life-saving mid-air twirl came just a second too late after swinging the Wiimote. As such, I was overjoyed last week to report on <em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars </em><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/super-mario-galaxys-spin-wont-be-as-annoying-in-super-m-1845003510\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/super-mario-galaxys-spin-wont-be-as-annoying-in-super-m-1845003510\">adding button inputs to <em>Galaxy</em></a></span>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">But that doesn’t mean motion controls have been entirely removed in <em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em>. Some of the more frustrating <em>Galaxy</em> mini-games, like manta surfing and rolling atop a Star ball, are still tied entirely to your ability to perfectly maintain your controller’s position and balance in the real world. This is just as much of a problem on the Switch as it was on the Wii, and really slams the brakes on the fun every time they show up.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">For better or worse, the <em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em> port of <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> is a faithful recreation of the original game, providing the player with beautiful galactic vistas and slamming them back down to the ground with the occasional motion-controlled annoyance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">It’s clear that Nintendo intends for <em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em> to function as a time machine, but for me, it’s also an inter-dimensional portal. I can remember where I was when I first played <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em> and <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>, and now I have strange memories of an alternate childhood playing <em>Super Mario 64</em> too.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">More than anything, however, <em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em> is a time capsule. The series’ progression from one game to the next provides a fascinating look at how Nintendo almost willed an entire genre into existence and then, just as quickly, scaled it back to just the bare necessities without missing a beat.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Every game in <em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em> is a triumph, a clear indication of why Mario has remained an inextricable part of gaming history. They don’t even have to tell you how to jump in these games anymore; Nintendo knows that every player’s thumb will inevitably hover to the appropriate button.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Although I have my qualms with this collection—strange inconsistencies in the <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em> port chief among them—it does what it set out to do: chart Mario’s evolution from a bushwhacking pioneer to the inimitable mascot of 3D platforming.</p>', '2024-03-11 11:34:44', '2024-03-11 11:34:44', 'Super Mario 3D All-Stars: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/wuojdgbo8kpdnus78qot.jpg', 'switch', 'https://kotaku.com/super-mario-3d-all-stars-the-kotaku-review-1845070139', 'Anyone who says “you can’t go home again” obviously never played a Mario game.\nM...', ''),

Where do Shy Guys go on their days off? <em>Paper Mario</em> is the only series brave enough to answer these burning questions about the inner lives of Mario characters, and it answers them with humor, style, and more truly human moments than you can find in most of Nintendo’s fantasy worlds.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">As a person who grew up drawing comics starring Mario characters, I have a soft spot in my heart for the <em>Paper Mario</em> series’ always hilarious, often heartwarming take on the world of Mario. Setting off on a grand adventure in the Mushroom Kingdom and getting to have amusing conversations with Pokeys and Thwomps is exactly my shit. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">So why was I not even able to finish either of the previous two games in the series, <em>Sticker Star</em> or <em>Color Splash</em>? I don’t particularly mind that Nintendo decided not to make these latest outings full-on role-playing games, despite that being the genre of the first two (universally praised) games in the series. I mean, I’d <em>prefer</em> they be RPGs, but I’m happy to take a flyer on an experiment.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">The issue was more with what <em>replaced</em> the RPG mechanics: a stingy economy of consumable items that had you constantly backtracking, scrounging for resources, and getting annoyed when a battle had you dump more of those resources than you’d hoped. And that happened a lot, as battles would often be based around using the exact right rare items at the exact right time, and leaving you up the creek if you messed it up, which you probably would since the games were also stingy with hints.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\"><em>Paper Mario: The Origami King</em> doesn’t back down from its anti-RPG stance, but its economy is far less miserly, there’s no backtracking necessary, and little getting in the way of the happy fun times. It’s not exactly what I want, but I’m fine with it, because the journey itself is worth it.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 khcaUW\">\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\"><em>Origami King</em> starts the way so many Mario games do; with Mario and Luigi on the way to Peach’s castle for a relaxing day full of (I assume) <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/everything-is-cake-now-including-dragon-ball-z-charact-1844369405\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/everything-is-cake-now-including-dragon-ball-z-charact-1844369405\">cake</a></span>. Before they even get there, though, their pleasant morning is interrupted by an evil piece of origami, who folds Peach into similarly evil origami and whisks her castle away to the peak of a volcano, surrounding it with massive paper streamers for good measure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Accompanied by the evil origami’s non-evil sister, Olivia, Mario must go on yet another quest to dismantle the streamers, unfold Peach, and take down the Origami King. (Luigi, as he often does during these games, goes off on his own quest that takes place mostly offstage, but intersects with Mario’s at key moments.)</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"jgyzv0pikmb4hscgtbah\" data-recommend-id=\"image://jgyzv0pikmb4hscgtbah\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"jgyzv0pikmb4hscgtbah\" data-recommend-id=\"image://jgyzv0pikmb4hscgtbah\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">What transpires is, at least superficially, structured like an action-tinged role-playing game. As Mario explores the game’s world (crafted to look like it’s made entirely of paper), he encounters enemies on the map. Touching them initiates a turn-based battle scene.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\"><em>Origami King</em>’s battles are unique. Rather than simply array enemies in a straight line in front of Mario as in other games in the series, the enemies are placed on a pattern formed of concentric circles, which can be rotated and shuffled around. Before you actually fight the enemies, you want to place them into straight lines of four, or two-by-two squares, so you can more effectively attack them. As soon as the battle starts, a timer starts ticking down, and you only have a limited amount of time to solve the puzzle.</p>\n\n<aside class=\"sc-1rh3ayr-6 htdlpl inset--story branded-item branded-item--kotaku\" data-commerce-source=\"inset\"><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-1rh3ayr-2 bmhLPh inset--story__thumb js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Permalink page click\",\"Permalink page click - inset photo\"]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/how-paper-mario-origami-kings-puzzle-battles-work-1844314696\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\n<span class=\"sc-ynl58c-0 jbNKBA\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" aria-label=\"Kotaku avatar\" viewbox=\"0 0 64 64\"><g fill=\"none\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\"><path fill=\"#FBC000\" d=\"M0 0h64v64H0z\"></path><path fill=\"#FFF\" d=\"M16.8 49.62l3.67-.14c4.05-.15 7.76-3.2 8.35-6.78l4.13-24.65-10.3-.3-5.84 31.87zM43.19 29.1c3.57.02 4.95 1.29 5.93 3.27l6.84 16.84c-1.73 1.54-9.79 1-12.08-5.04l-2.5-6.72h-1.15c-3.8.06-9.2-2.78-8.03-8.4l11 .05zm-22.2-11.38l-5.59-.16c-7.78-.22-9.93 5.3-9.28 8.88l13.26.13 1.6-8.85zm31.55 7.69c2.62-1.66 3.74-7.65 1.9-9.4l-13.51 3.4c-2.3 1.28-4.94 5.01-2.33 9.15l13.94-3.15z\"></path></g></svg></span></a></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Solving the ring puzzles and aligning the enemies is <em>technically</em> optional. You can still win battles without doing it. But you’re heavily incentivized to perfectly finish the puzzles. Your attack power actually goes up by 50 percent when everything is aligned properly, which means that you’ll probably be able to take down every enemy without them even getting a turn. And you also get quite a few bonus coins at the end of battles both for solving puzzles perfectly and for taking no damage.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Fail to solve the puzzle and the battle will be a slog; you’ll probably take damage and have to use more consumable items trying to finish it, and then you’ll get less of a reward in the end. (Later in the game, as the puzzles get harder, you can turn on the “puzzle solver” item, which doesn’t actually solve the puzzles but does show you where the enemies should be placed when you’re done. I turned this on and still found some real head-scratchers in the back half.)</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">The puzzles tended to be hit-or-miss: Either I could instantly see the solution (or it fell into place by itself after I rotated some likely rings), or I would be totally stumped and have to brute-force my way through the battle. <em>Origami King</em> does give you some lifelines, although they’re not guarantees. You can spend coins to add seconds to the timer, for one. There’s also an audience of Toads in the battle arena, and you can pay them to “cheer you on,” which could involve rearranging the enemies into an easier configuration, if you pay them enough.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"hdxzv5oysbmeil2a8eua\" data-recommend-id=\"image://hdxzv5oysbmeil2a8eua\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"hdxzv5oysbmeil2a8eua\" data-recommend-id=\"image://hdxzv5oysbmeil2a8eua\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">I didn’t end up using these options much, because they tended to be more expensive than the alternative of just sucking it up, failing the puzzle, and taking less of a coin bonus at the end of the battle. And coins are paramount in the world of <em>Origami King</em>. In fact, coins are the <em>only</em> thing its battles give you. You don’t win items, you don’t get experience points—you get cash. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">And cash is king. Want to take less damage in battle? You’ll have to buy accessories that bump your defense. Want to deal out more pain? You’ll need to buy (or find hidden in the world) more powerful hammers and boots. These break after several uses, so you’ll need to keep stocking up. (Fortunately, they’re not very expensive, you can carry a lot of them, and they take a while to break.) And if you’re a completionist, you’ll need to spend your coins to fill the in-game museum with collectibles.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">One of the criticisms of the last two games is that they actively dissuade you from going into battles at all, since their battles barely give you enough reward to make up for the consumable items you’ll use to win them. Not so in <em>Origami King</em>. I actively sought out battles throughout the game because it rewards you richly for them. And because they’re enjoyable, mostly. When the pieces line up just right and you’re able to wipe out a grid full of enemies without taking a scratch, it feels good! </p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"ccmv9fsxcnnwxdakk3ui\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ccmv9fsxcnnwxdakk3ui\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"ccmv9fsxcnnwxdakk3ui\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ccmv9fsxcnnwxdakk3ui\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">I found the boss battles to be more interesting than the standard ones. When you face off against a boss, <em>they’re</em> in the center of the rings, while Mario begins on the outside. The rings now become a sort of board game, with arrows, action spaces, helpful items, hazards, etc. You’ve got to arrange them to create a pathway that Mario will walk on, picking up items, avoiding bad things, and finally landing on an action square that will let him attack the enemy (or heal up).</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Since there’s no one single solution to these boss battle puzzles, they give you a little bit more leeway to be creative and try to craft the best possible pathway, while still being effective even if you’re not able to scoop up <em>all</em> the rewards on your way to punching the boss. The only annoying thing about some of these battles is that enemies have specific strengths and weaknesses, but you might not find out about these unless you try to do something and fail. (However, since single-use consumable items are never a factor, it’s far less annoying than it could have been.)</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">There’s even another type of battling in <em>Origami King</em>, which takes place in classic real-time action-RPG style, right out in the field. Giant “Paper Macho” enemies roam the world and need to be dispatched via Mario’s hammer. At first, these are low-stakes affairs—dodge a Goomba, hit it in its weak point, repeat until it explodes in a shower of confetti—but later on you’ll fight entire multi-phase boss monsters in this mode. These encounters are simple enough that you couldn’t build an entire game around them, but are infrequent enough that they’re always a nice break.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Mario’s stats do increase during the adventure, they just don’t do so via EXP earned from battles. Obtainable hearts raise your maximum HP, and when you find one, Olivia comments that you’ve “become a bit stronger, too.” So there <em>are</em> stats, and underlying math to Mario’s powers. The game just deliberately hides it all.</p>\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 khcaUW\">\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Where Paper Mario has always excelled is the story. Yes, the broad strokes of it are rote to the point of self-parody by now: Princess Peach is imperiled, a mysterious new character appears to assist Mario, Bowser shows up and lends a hand. It’s not the destination that’s worthwhile, it’s all the stops along the way.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">While it couldn’t be called an “open world” by any measure, <em>Origami King</em>’s locations are imaginative, rewarding to explore, and full of detail. As you trek around, you’ll find many “holes” in the paper environments, which you can fill in with confetti to open up new places or just earn a few coins. Levels are also filled with many hidden Toads who have been folded up into origami; as you find more of them, they will fill out the bleachers in the battle arena and give you more rewards when you pay them to cheer you on.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"rhj1mcilkufon2oszw81\" data-recommend-id=\"image://rhj1mcilkufon2oszw81\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"rhj1mcilkufon2oszw81\" data-recommend-id=\"image://rhj1mcilkufon2oszw81\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">One of my favorite levels, Shogun Studios, is a feudal Japan-themed amusement park slash movie studio that’s clearly based on the real-life Toei Studio Park, just a stone’s throw away from the Kyoto offices where <em>Paper Mario</em> was developed. What seems like a simple gag turns out to be an extensive quest, where you have to explore and unlock the entire park, go through various attractions, and finally unlock the massive theater at its center for an epic showdown. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">But there are simpler pleasures, too, like exploring a field of autumn trees, sailing on an ocean discovering islands, or riding over rolling desert dunes at night and digging up buried treasure. The artistry on display is always impressive, and paired with a beautiful soundtrack recorded with live instruments.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"c0lk26ubxy5wugwoaj2e\" data-recommend-id=\"image://c0lk26ubxy5wugwoaj2e\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"c0lk26ubxy5wugwoaj2e\" data-recommend-id=\"image://c0lk26ubxy5wugwoaj2e\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">The real pleasure is always when you find someone to talk to. Since the origami soldiers completely overran Mario’s world, Bowser and his minions are all on Mario’s team; this means any standard paper characters you see are friendlies, and you can chat them up to see what’s on their minds. Occasionally one will join up with you for a while, automatically doing assist moves in battle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">I don’t know what the people who write <em>Paper Mario</em>’s English-language scripts are getting paid, but I know that it is not enough. I can’t remember the last game that made me laugh so hard so many times. Often, it’s some kind of deep-cut reference to a previous Mario game. Sometimes it’s a funny observation about real life that’s somehow even funnier when it’s spoken by a Toad. Sometimes you wander into a coffee shop to find a Goomba and a Shy Guy arguing over lattes about which one is the best basic minion. If you love <em>Mario</em> lore, this game is made by people who love it as much as you do, and probably more.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">I also now have to do that annoying game-reviewer thing where I say there’s a plot line that really impressed me, but that the embargo for this game review explicitly says that I can’t mention it. Sorry! Just know that there are other excellent things that I’d love to call out about the story, but cannot.</p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Paper Mario: The Origami King\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">I wish the Switch had a proper gameplay time counter. All I can say is that the Switch tells me that I have played<em> Origami King</em> for “30 hours or more.” There’s no timer on my save file, because in keeping with <em>Paper Mario</em>’s removal of RPG elements, it has no save file system—there’s one single save file attached to each profile on the system that automatically loads when you begin the game.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Either way, it’s a lengthy game, and if you want to squeeze out a few more hours of playtime after dethroning the Origami King, some optional challenges await you out in the fields. But there’s no post-game story or anything like that—you can just go back to right before the final boss and (easily) backtrack out of the level to get back into the world and clean up. The game keeps track of how many hidden Toads, treasures, holes, and hidden question-mark blocks you’ve located, and gives you tools to find the last few you missed on the way.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">I’m not sure why Nintendo feels that <em>Paper Mario</em> can’t be a role-playing game: What exactly was the issue with the original games, which were widely praised and sold very well? But the major issue for me was not that Nintendo removed the series’ RPG mechanics, but that what it replaced them with was not as good. <em>Origami King</em> might not be the successor to <em>Thousand-Year Door </em>for which fans have been clamoring, but this time the formula works, allowing the series’ great writing and worlds to shine through.  </p>', '2024-03-11 11:34:44', '2024-03-11 11:34:44', 'Paper Mario: The Origami King: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/xn2uegozcmbdamwycm9l.jpg', 'switch', 'https://kotaku.com/paper-mario-the-origami-king-the-kotaku-review-1844379684', 'What do Red Koopa Troopas think about as they’re shuffling back and forth all da...', '');

Well, less of a vacation and more of a… sojourn, I guess you could call it. A close friend of mine, Tom Nook, has started a new business offering relocations to a deserted island. There are discounts for those who can help with some early foraging. I have no idea how he found this place, but I’m willing to overlook that if he can help me get away from it all for a little while.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Almost every day there are new anxieties. My head feels about ready to implode. It’s good to care about stuff, but I need to find a way to stop agonizing over everything to such extreme levels. I’m hoping Nook’s island (and the complimentary makeover he provides beforehand) will be just the ticket. I’ll be keeping this journal to track my progress.</p>\n<h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h4451\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>February 28, 2020</h3>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">The plane ride was fine. I’m not one for being tens of thousands of miles in the air, but the dodo birds that got us to our island were very kind and helpful. It wasn’t quite as fancy as I was expecting from a private jet but much more comfortable than the coach flights I’ve taken previously. Besides Nook and me, there were two passengers: a rooster named Goose and a cat named Katt. Not the most imaginative names, but maybe they run in the family? Who am I to judge?</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Goose is one of those athletic types. He spent a lot of the flight doing pushups and crunches in the aisle, but he doesn’t seem too bad. Nothing overbearing about him. He just seems to have a lot of energy. Maybe he’s nervous like me and this is how he deals with it? Our other companion, Katt, mostly kept to herself, but every so often I would hear her singing softly near the back of the cabin. It was nice.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">We arrived on the island in the evening, giving us just enough time to collect our camping gear from Nook before the sun disappeared over the horizon. Still, no one seemed to be in any hurry. Nook came prepared with enough supplies to last months, even if more customers took him up on his getaway offer. I watched Goose and Katt wander off in opposite directions before setting my tent up next to the beach near the airport. I still wasn’t sure about this whole deserted island nonsense, so I wanted to be as close to an escape as possible.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"worxmndpyn2cjx7kc8so\" data-recommend-id=\"image://worxmndpyn2cjx7kc8so\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"worxmndpyn2cjx7kc8so\" data-recommend-id=\"image://worxmndpyn2cjx7kc8so\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Since I finished first, Nook asked me if I could go around and collect cherries from some nearby trees. They weren’t hard to find; it seems like cherries are the only fruit that grow here. I brought him a few armfuls. Nook and his sons, Timmy and Tommy, set about working in their tent, and came back out carrying several frosty mugs of cold, cherry smoothies. We all gathered around a large bonfire near the main, central area of our little settlement, sipping our drinks and watching the stars. Nook asked us to make suggestions for the island’s name, and we settled on Aurora. As time passed by, we scuttled back to our tents, each of us nodding silently to the others as we bid goodnight.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">I fell asleep to the sound of ocean waves.</p>\n<h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h4452\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>March 1, 2020</h3>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Nook’s voice woke me up as it crackled from a loudspeaker, a mixture of interference and his own feverish, high-pitched rambling.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Sometime during the night, he and the twins set up a system to make announcements in the common area. Not that I find Nook annoying or anything, but getting roused from a great night’s sleep during what is supposed to be a vacation (or sojourn) is pretty annoying. Thankfully, all he asked is for me and my island neighbors to gather at the central square when we had a moment. I turned over in my warm sleeping bag and tried to grab a few more winks.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">I found getting back to sleep difficult, so I made my way towards Nook’s tent, which he has taken to calling Resident Services. Seems all he wanted was to give everyone a special cell phone so that we can all keep in touch. There isn’t much on there at the moment, but Nook said he’ll periodically push out updates with new apps and the like. I immediately received a notification for something called “Nook Miles,” which Nook explained will act as a sort of secondary currency on the island in addition to Bells. We’ll get Nook Miles, he said, for doing ordinary things like talking to our fellow island residents and planting flowers, which can then be exchanged for special items at a terminal in his tent. This also helps him keep up with the island’s transition from deserted to habitable, apparently.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Since I was already around, I decided to ask Nook about settling the bill for this trip. He surprised me by saying he was going to accept the initial travel fees in Nook Miles rather than money. This means our early work on the island directly contributes to what we owe his company for getting us here. What would have normally cost almost 50,000 Bells came out to just 5,000 Nook Miles. Not a bad deal!</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Nook also made sure to point out the workbench in the Resident Services tent. Our phones include several “recipes” for do-it-yourself projects like simple tools to help us fix up and interact with the ecosystem of Aurora Island. The materials needed for these projects—rocks, wood, clay, sticks, and the like—are readily available in our surroundings and easy enough to gather with an axe or shovel. Nook explained how items I’ve already crafted, like a simple campfire, can be upgraded at the workbench into a more substantial bonfire with additional resources. As I was heading out, Timmy and Tommy stopped me to show how I could make a cute leaf umbrella with some weeds, which I made sure to do before leaving. This is a tropical island, after all.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Stepping outside, I blinked the sun out of my eyes and took in my new home for the first time. The area Nook had us set up was cut off from the rest of the island by rivers. They don’t seem too deep, but I quickly ruled out fording or swimming across. Instead, I pulled out my flimsy fishing rod and settled down on the riverbank. I managed to reel in a medium-sized green fish just as the sun was setting. I rushed off to show Nook. He took a quick look and said it was probably a black bass before asking if he could send it off to his friend. This friend owns a museum, Nook explained, and would love to take a look at the specimen I caught. Wanting to know more about the fish, I agreed. Nook stored it away for shipping later and we said our goodbyes for the night.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Goose stopped me on my way back to my tent and handed me a small package. He was very proud of the wrapping but hurried me into opening it. Inside was a red hat with a blue band, looking like a more stylish version of something a traditional fisherman might wear. Goose said that he had noticed how excited I was to catch my black bass and thought the hat might give me good luck on future fishing expeditions. I didn’t know what to say. It’s been a long time since someone thought of me like that, and I choked back a few tears to avoid making things awkward between me and my new friend.<br></p>\n<h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h4453\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>March 3, 2020</h3>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">I can already tell life on this island isn’t going to be boring.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Our third day on the island was pretty uneventful, but I woke up today to find a museum had opened overnight, curated by Nook’s owl friend, Blathers. Blathers was so entranced by the black bass that we sent him that he decided to make the move to Aurora Island to study the wildlife. Like us, he’s starting out small, but said he would build a much larger building if I kept bringing him bugs, fish, and fossils to study. It doesn’t seem like Blathers is interested in searching for these specimens himself, but he gave me a vaulting pole to get over rivers. That enabled me to get to the rest of the island. After a few practice leaps, I began to love the feeling of whooshing through the air.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">It was during one of these parabolic adventures that I spotted something strange on the beach near my home. A white and blue mound stood out on the toasted sand, seemingly unperturbed by the encroaching waves. As I walked over, I realized it was a person. He was still breathing, thankfully, and muttering to himself in his sleep. After a few nudges, he coughed up some sea water in the process. He introduced himself as Gulliver, “seafaring seagull of the seven seas,” and explained that he had fallen overboard the night before. I helped him gather up the pieces of his broken cell phone, and he called his crewmates to pick him up. Gulliver promised to send me a gift through the mail as thanks, but I’m not expecting anything. He didn’t seem all there, to be honest, but that might have just been the shock of washing up on some random island.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Since I was here anyway, I decided to spiff up my little section of the beach with a folding chair, a campfire, and a couple of tiki torches. It doesn’t look like much right now, but I’m banking on it being a nice getaway when the sun sets. It’s a calm little setup to sit and watch the stars and listen to the waves. I wasn’t much of an ocean person before coming to Aurora Island but now I can’t get enough of that ever-present, low rumble. As I explored other parts of the beach, I cut my foot on something sticking out of the sand. Turns out the area is absolutely littered with clams. I think I can turn them into bait to help me on my next fishing session. Anything is better than the boring lure I’m using now.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"pi3n0cfwfb2rwvqi4rlt\" data-recommend-id=\"image://pi3n0cfwfb2rwvqi4rlt\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1059\" data-height=\"595\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"pi3n0cfwfb2rwvqi4rlt\" data-recommend-id=\"image://pi3n0cfwfb2rwvqi4rlt\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1059\" data-height=\"595\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">There’s a lot more to this deserted island than meets the eye initially. Apart from the beaches and the lush inland full of cherry trees, I’ve found rock formations, tide pools, and hillsides covered in wildflowers. It’s a natural beauty I’ve never experienced before. I find myself just wandering, with small pauses to take in everything around me. I don’t think I’ve ever seen water so blue, flora so vibrant and green, or insects so perfectly complex as I have on Aurora Island. It’s overwhelming, but not in the way the world I left behind can be overwhelming. Instead of internal pressure, my head feels light and open, accepting of everything around me. My eyes water as if making room for the next incredible sight. Even now, writing in this notebook, I can see blue skies and clouds reflecting in the shallows, a mirror image of heaven.<br></p>\n<h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h4454\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>March 4, 2020</h3>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">I swear to god I saw a freaking ghost tonight.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">I was wandering along the east edge of the island, doing some fishing in the ocean, when I caught sight of a glowing orb among the trees. At first I thought it was just a firefly, but after rushing into the thicket with my net at the ready, I came face to face with a literal spirit. I screamed, of course, but what’s funny is that the ghost screamed too, sort of like what you see in comedy movies.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">For some reason, the ghost—whose name is Wisp, by the way—thought I was the ghost. A ghost that’s afraid of ghosts… what a world. Anyway, when Wisp freaked out, little pieces of his body split off and scattered across the island. I felt guilty, so I offered to catch them for him. He seemed to calm down a bit then and waited for me to return.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Wisp was so happy to have a complete body again that he offered me a gift. I had to choose between something I didn’t own or something expensive. Naturally, I went with the expensive option. Wisp gave me a pair of fancy sneakers and then disappeared.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">I wonder if I’ll see that weird little ghost again.</p>\n<h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h4455\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>March 6, 2020</h3>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">The official museum opened on Aurora Island today and it’s absolutely gorgeous. I have no idea how Nook and Blathers put all this together in just one night, but I’m more inspired than ever to contribute specimens to its halls.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">The building is split into three sections for fish, bugs, and fossils, each of which have their own themed sub-sections. When entering the aquatic area, for instance, you’re greeted with small ponds separated by wooden walkways, sort of like you’re walking among marshlands. Further in, the displays hold fish found in deeper waters. The dim lighting of the rooms combines with the illuminated tanks to mimic sunbeams filtering through the surface of the ocean. It’s quite the sight.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">I stopped by Goose and Katt’s places to see what they thought of the new museum and was surprised to find they weren’t living in tents anymore. They had real deal houses! With a small twinge of jealousy, I ran over to Resident Services and asked Nook about upgrading. Luckily, I had enough Nook Miles to pay off the initial travel fees, which got me ready for a new house by tomorrow morning. This crazy raccoon dog must be breaking labor laws to get these things built so fast, but I pushed that to the back of my mind for now.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">I was also able to redeem some Nook Miles for a guide on how to organize my pockets a bit better, increasing the amount of stuff I’m able to carry at one time, and recipes for improved tools. The flimsy tools I was using before were prone to breaking, but with these upgrades, they last much longer. Still, it’s a little rough having to keep replacing my tools or carrying multiples if I want to get any work done, but I guess that’s life on a deserted island for you.</p>\n<h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h4456\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>March 7, 2020</h3>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Somehow, the rest of the folks on Aurora Island have designated me Resident Representative. I guess I am the one who is always getting work done while the other folks watch butterflies and mill around Resident Services, but man, that seems like a lot of responsibility. I never quite bought into Nook’s pitch of conquering the wilderness and all that. I think Aurora Island is cool the way it is. But everyone else is convinced we need to expand. Timmy and Tommy even asked me to find space for them to build a shop! Stuff was moving way too fast for me today, so I ran over to the airport and asked the dodos to take me somewhere, anywhere for a few hours.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">They dropped me off on a random island with no name. It looked a lot like Aurora did when we first landed a week ago, if only a little smaller. Knowing the pilot was waiting for me at the dock gave me the courage to wander for a bit before bumping into two other travelers: Rosie the cat, who has dreams of becoming a pop star, and Zucker the octopus, who looks kind of like a takoyaki ball. Is that rude to say out loud? Maybe I’ll just keep that one to myself.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Rosie and Zucker offered me a seat at their campfire. They could probably tell I was a little stressed and asked what was up. I didn’t offload as much as I needed to, but they seemed supportive. After a while, they both were talking about how nice our island sounded and asking for coordinates. I think they’re going to move in at some point but I’m not sure. In any case, it reminded me how good I have it over on Aurora Island. Things may be moving a little fast for my liking but it’s still nothing compared to the life I left behind. I returned home with a renewed optimism, ready to get those rambunctious tanuki twins set up in their very own shop.</p>\n<h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h4457\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>March 9, 2020</h3>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Nook said my first order of business today was setting up three new houses on Aurora Island. Two were for those nice folks I met yesterday, while another is for a koala named Melba.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">It seems that, whenever someone is ready to move to the island, it will be my responsibility to ensure that they have a place to stay beforehand. That means choosing a plot of land for them to settle as well as crafting furniture and decorations for both the inside and outside of their homes. Nook provides the recipes, but I found myself having to scoop up materials due to my personal reserves being low.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Fortunately, there’s something special about my axe. It lets me thwack and thwack on trees to get various types of wood without actually cutting them down. Same thing with shovels and rocks. There’s only so much I can harvest a day, but it’s still super helpful.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">I still haven’t quite figured out how to craft multiple items at once, so I have to make things one by one. This gets especially frustrating when making stuff for which I’ll always want multiples, like fish bait or tools. That said, my house does come equipped with a rather sizable storage unit. I’ve collected a ton of stuff so far and I’m not even close to filling it up. Nook also said that this storage space will increase with every upgrade my home receives.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"sfdudnxtspv8cg9vi7nu\" data-recommend-id=\"image://sfdudnxtspv8cg9vi7nu\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"sfdudnxtspv8cg9vi7nu\" data-recommend-id=\"image://sfdudnxtspv8cg9vi7nu\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Timmy and Tommy asked me to visit their new shop, Nook’s Cranny, today so they could give me the lowdown. They offer a few items for sale a day, including some simple tools, and they pay good money for practically everything I find on the island. There’s also a special Hot Item designated each day that nets me double the Bells. They close at 10 p.m., but there’s a drop box outside that can take items overnight. The twins promise to deposit money in my account for these nightly sales the next day, but at a 20% markdown. Since I’m doing a lot of work late at night these days—always chasing the last chore or item crafting—this could prove useful.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">While leaving the shop, I almost ran smack into a cute hedgehog. She introduced herself as Mabel, another new visitor to the island. She wasn’t sure about moving here since she runs a clothing business with her sisters elsewhere, but mentioned that she’ll visit from time to time to sell some of their wares. Later on, I noticed she had set up a small wagon near Resident Services with a few pieces of clothing, a lot of it really nice quality. Mabel seems interested in moving here with her sisters at some point, but I’m not sure what it will take other than providing regular business.</p>\n<h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h4458\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>March 10, 2020</h3>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">I’m trying to fill up my days with little chores to keep me from, well, napping. It feels good to get out and be productive, especially when the results of your labor are instantly noticeable. So far, I’ve weeded a large majority of the island—and since today’s Hot Item at Nook’s Cranny was Hay Beds, I was able to turn a nice profit with a little bit of elbow grease—and helped Nook set up a log bridge for our new residents. There still isn’t a way to get up to the higher elevations besides a neat little portable ladder Nook showed me how to make, so it’s been my duty to scale those hills and make sure they look nice in anticipation of future expansion.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Oh, and I managed to find a nice, private beach on the backside of the island that I haven’t told anyone about yet. Doesn’t appear to hide anything special; it’s just been nice to head back there and chill for a bit. Don’t get me wrong, I love my neighbors, but it’s fun to imagine what it would be like if I had Aurora Island all to myself. It would probably get pretty lonely after the freedom wore off. Oh well!</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Somehow a rumor started that the famous musician K. K. Slider was going to visit Aurora Island tonight, so some of us hung out in the town square for a few hours to see if anything would come of it. Nook didn’t seem to have any idea what was going on, but we just took that as him being coy. Slider never showed, sadly. How does a rumor even start on a small island like this? Anyway, we ended up having our own concert instead, with Goose and Katt singing and me on ocarina. I’ve been messing around with this little instrument for a couple of days, but I still can’t manage anything more than a few random notes. They didn’t seem to mind.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h4459\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>March 12, 2020</h3>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">I told everyone that I was going to take a day to chill and think about some stuff. Most of them were surprised to find out I wasn’t chilling already. Aurora Island is bustling, sure, but the rest of the folks don’t seem to be as interested in “improving” it as I have been. Really makes me think about the time I’ve spent here so far and my place in this new environment. Maybe I don’t have to be running around all the time, gathering fish and materials. Sure, my house is nice, but do I really need all these clothes? Why was I so adamant about finding the right color sheets for my bed? It feels like I brought all my old problems with me, as if I’m cursed or something.</p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Animal Cross: New Horizons\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">We’re coming up on almost two weeks here, but it feels like it’s been much longer than that with all the work I’ve put in. Aurora Island looks so much different than it did just thirteen days ago, thanks mostly to my efforts. But no one really asked me to do these things. Every task Nook gave me was more of a suggestion, something I <em>could</em> do if I managed to fit it into my own schedule. Everything happens tomorrow here. Maybe I’m uncomfortable waiting for tomorrow, so I try to fill the hours with pointless searching: searching for purpose, searching for the next item that will make me whole and happy, searching for something that makes life easier to digest. I try to talk to my fellow islanders about these things but I always stop just short of getting serious, unwilling to burden them with my own personal issues.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Starting today, I’m going to take steps to really soak in the atmosphere of Aurora Island. Earlier, I sent off letters to all my neighbors with little gifts thanking them for being who they are. Nothing fancy or expensive, just knickknacks and loving notes. I’m sure they’ll love them. It seems like they love everything. And really, what’s not to love about this life? It’s a far cry from the rat race of the real world. Everyone provides for one another. Everyone is encouraging. I need to appreciate what I’ve found without attaching my own baggage to every little moment and interaction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Nook has mentioned wanting to attract more visitors to Aurora Island, starting with K. K. Slider. (Maybe he got that idea from us?) The first part of his plan is to set up a campsite so folks can come here and check things out without officially moving in. To help with this, Nook upgraded Resident Services into a full-fledged building. He also brought an adorable dog named Isabelle on board to help with things like changing the island’s flag and song. She seems very upbeat, and the little bell on her hair tie jingles with every step she takes.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">But my first order of business after this morning’s introspection was fishing. Not fishing like I usually do, using bait off the pier in hopes of catching blue marlins or tuna to sell for tens of thousands of Bells at Timmy and Tommy’s shop. No, this was just about getting back into relaxation mode. Settling myself. Funny enough, today was the first day I’ve dragged trash out of the ocean. An empty aluminum can here, a tire there, a couple of slick, raggedy boots. But instead of tossing them out, I got some wild ideas for DIY projects. The can made a nice display for several wildflowers I found further into the island. The tire became an abstract decoration just outside my home. And the boots, well, they’re boots. Not my style but they might go well with an outfit later on, so I’m keeping them in my wardrobe for now.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">That’s probably what I love best about Aurora Island. Everything and everybody is meaningful, not just because they can be polished into something beautiful but because they were already beautiful to begin with. This island is a promise. Life isn’t supposed to be better or worse here, it’s just supposed to be different. It has its own rhythm and pace. I can wake up in the morning, grab a few seashells off the beach, and say hello to Zucker as he hunts for butterflies. I can spend the day redecorating my bedroom and sending off stuff I don’t need as gifts. I can focus on gathering supplies and building improvements for the town. Or I can just stay home and listen to my K. K. Slider records… still looking for that first-print vinyl of “Two Days Ago,” by the way.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Aurora Island started off as an escape, a way for me to run away from the people and things that were weighing me down. It became so much more than that in just a short amount of time. I found community here. Not a community shackled together by economy or industry, but one connected by mutual compassion. That doesn’t mean everyone is blithely ignorant of reality or brainwashed into mind-numbing positivity, but there’s an undercurrent of tenderness for your fellow animal that inspires each and every action we take. I know life is waiting for me back on the mainland. I know this can’t last forever. But in the meantime, I’m going to absorb as much from my time here as possible in the hopes of taking at least a little bit of Aurora back with me.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 khcaUW\">\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\"><em>(The rest of the notebook is filled with photos and doodles of fish.

I reliably made it through three of the four Pokémon on his team before getting my shit completely wrecked by his last monster. Even without Dynamaxing, that monster was destroying every Pokémon on my team. I tried to brute force it by overleveling. No dice. I changed up my team, grinding some more to bring them up to speed. Still not working. It was after my third time losing that I realized Allister was using a particular set of moves to increase the monster’s attack power to astronomical levels. I had to change up my strategy. For the first time in my adult life, I was seriously thinking about strategy in a <em>Pokémon</em> game, and I had a blast doing it.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">The trickiest thing about <em>Pokémon</em> is trying to figure out who it’s for. After 20 years, the behemoth series has accrued many masters to serve: kids, competitive players, and grown-ups who just want to pet a Pikachu. As such, <em>Sword</em> and <em>Shield</em> have already been divisive for months before release. Ever since it was announced that it would not be possible to import every Pokémon into this generation’s games, there has been a subset of fans who have primed themselves to hate this game. It’s easy to focus on this loud group decrying “Dexit,” the moniker they’ve given the cut roster of monsters. But that’s not the only story of <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/11/20959420/pokemon-sword-shield-pokedex-game-freak-trending\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/11/20959420/pokemon-sword-shield-pokedex-game-freak-trending\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">what it means to be a<em> Pokémon</em> fan right now</a></span>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Since <em>Red</em> and <em>Blue</em> released for the GameBoy in 1998, <em>Pokémon </em>has been a phenomenon. For many people my age, <em>Pokémon</em> is a relic of childhood, a tangible piece of nostalgia that miraculously keeps reappearing. So I want this review to clear some things up. I won’t currently address all of the complaints due to res<!-- -->trictions on spoilers, but I can say, unequivocally: <em>Pokémon</em> <em>Sword</em> and <em>Shield</em> are good games.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Though I keep returning with each installment, my interest in <em>Pokémon</em> has waned. Too little has been improved in its user interfaces, and certain mechanics, like the methods for evolving or obtaining certain Pokémon, have remained needlessly obtuse, to say nothing of the time-consuming and highly specific methods necessary to train Pokémon for competitive play. The plots and characters are often rote to the point that even children must feel condescended to. The recent games are disappointingly easy. Yet as I lament squandered opportunities for the series to grow, I admit that I’m always hopeful for what I always seek in games: a sense of wonder. A Pokémon game hasn’t truly made me feel that way since I booted up <em>Red</em>, met Professor Oak, and embarked on my adventure. For the first time since I was a 7-year-old falling in love with her Charmander, <em>Sword</em> and <em>Shield</em> gave me that sense of wonder.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">I was awestruck when I ventured into the Wild Area, a new feature for <em>Sword </em>and <em>Shield</em>. There, Pokémon roam on the overworld, occasionally chasing after you as you pass by. There are Pokémon at a much, much higher level than the monsters that surround them—and your own team. There is a chance that if you go out into the Wild Area, you will just see all your monsters faint as they’re swiped at by a gigantic, terrifying raven. It’s how I imagined the Pokémon world as a kid: teeming with life and an undertone of danger. Though there is a level cap on the Pokémon you can catch that corresponds to your gym badge, it’s in place to prevent you from catching one of these monsters and cheesing through parts of the game—which makes sense, since you’d never encounter wild Pokémon this much stronger than you in previous games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Many of the features that make the game more accessible are optional. In fact, other than the EXP. Share (which you unfortunately can’t turn off but isn’t disruptive to the difficulty), you don’t even have to touch any of the things that make the game easier for people who are lazy, are busy, or are currently children. Though you can access your Pokémon storage boxes at most times, I elected to never use it because it felt like too much of a shortcut for me. I’m sure other people will gladly take advantage of it. Items like Feathers, which change your Pokémon’s base stats, or <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWGGtKgalDo\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWGGtKgalDo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mints, which change your Pokémon’s nature</a></span>, are never foisted upon you if you don’t want them. There are also new ways to bring your Pokémon up to speed that don’t involve grinding. Poké Jobs, where different companies request Pokémon of a certain type, like asking for bug type ’mons to help make fabric, yield a ton of experience points and also some items or cash.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">My favorite way to level up Pokémon quickly, though, was Max Raid Battles. In those, you play with three other real people or computer characters to defeat a huge, ultra-powerful version of a Pokémon. If you defeat them, you have a chance to catch them, and you’ll also gain berries, TRs (one-use technical machines), and candies that give experience points. They started off pretty easy, but they scale up in difficulty the more that you do them. While the servers to play with others weren’t available while I was playing, I imagine that coordinating with real life players will be necessary once you’ve reached the more difficult raids.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Part of that is because Dynamaxing isn’t just a “press this button to win” mechanic, as I’d feared it’d be. That’s how I felt about Z-Moves in <em>Sun</em> and <em>Moon</em>. Modern games have been marred by mechanics that felt slapped on and completely neutered the difficulty. Dynamax Pokémon are very powerful, but there have been times that even with a type advantage, even when I was overleveled, my opponent could still break through my strategy and make me think on my feet.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">In battle, every time there’s a change to stats for your Pokémon or an opponent’s, it will be denoted in the info panel, which you can open by hitting Y. It’ll also show the status effects in play, the weather, and what these things do. The way that <em>Sword </em>and <em>Shield</em> is eager to show you as much information as it possibly can allowed me to more clearly see how its systems work in concert. I got far more invested in not just raising my Pokémon but seeing what they could do in battle.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">The game’s preoccupation with sports culture and fandom amplified these feelings. Gym Battles now take place in massive public arenas, where the crowd reacts to your wins and losses. The stunning upsets and last-minute saves are reflected by this simulated audience. Sometimes, I imagined my former colleagues at <em>Deadspin</em> blogging about my journey as it unfolded, the story of my rise documented in the same way that the Toronto Raptors’ performance in the NBA playoffs made a legend of Kawhi Leonard. The game repeatedly emphasizes that a rival to challenge you is what turns a competitor into a champion, and it’s got the gameplay to back that up—the series of youngsters that make up your rivals have their own stories and serve as fun counterpoints to your own adventure. They reminded me of sports movie archetypes: the eager go-getter, the overserious competitor. Hell, I’d just watch a movie about Bede, the arrogant and brash trainer that you cross paths with during your journey, who has a narrative arc similar to Adonis Creed’s in <em>Creed</em> (though it’s mostly portrayed off screen).<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Outside of battle, you can camp with your Pokémon, play with them, and cook curry for them. Playing with Pokémon isn’t hugely engaging, but it’s amusing to watch my Sobble pounce on a feather cat toy, or to play fetch with my Wooloo. Cooking is a cute mini-game and has real utility in game play. In order to make Curry, you combine berries and other ingredients you can buy or earn through Poké Jobs. This heals your Pokémon and provides them with experience points, making it a good way to save potions or revives for when you really need them. There are so many ways to approach <em>Sword </em>and<em> Shield</em> that people can play it however they want.</p>\n\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Pokémon Sword and Shield\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">There are legitimate critiques to make about <em>Pokémon Sword</em> and <em>Shield</em>. The game is challenging, sure, but it never kept me up at night. The plot is pretty lackluster; for example, nothing reaches the narrative heights of <em>Black</em> and <em>White</em>. The environments outside of cities and towns not exactly awe-inspiring, and anyone hoping for a very specific Pokémon in this game from previous entries will more likely than not be disappointed. There are times that the game holds your hand that will feel irritating if you’re an adult, especially in its earliest hours. Yet after the credits rolled, I couldn’t stop myself from reopening my save file.

After all, it was nearly 20 years ago that he Hoovered up an entire building full of poltergeists in the original <em>Luigi’s Mansion</em>. Then he cleared out <em>six</em> haunted houses in <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/luigis-mansion-dark-moon-the-kotaku-review-5991963\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/luigis-mansion-dark-moon-the-kotaku-review-5991963\">2013\'s <em>Dark Moon</em></a></span>. As he enters a massive spook-infested hotel in this month’s <em>Luigi’s Mansion 3</em>, one would expect him to handle things with a little more bravado this time. But alas.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\"><strong><em>This piece was first published on October 28, 2019. We’re bumping it today for the game’s release.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Teeth permanently achatter, ghost-sucking vacuum firmly in hand, Luigi returns to the land of the formerly ali<!-- -->ve in this new Switch game, available October 31. Despite how Luigi feels about the whole thing, I wouldn’t call any of it especially scary, just a charming supernatural comedy in an environment packed with rich detail. There’s lots to do in this haunted hotel and the core mechanic of catching ghosts stays fun the whole way through.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Whether it’s a mansion or a hotel, the gameplay remains the same: Creep slowly through a darkened building full of traps, vermin, ghosts, and treasure, methodically clearing out each floor of spirits and money, using a backpack-mounted vacuum to inhale the specters and put them into cold storage until such time as they are released again in <em>Luigi’s Mansion 4</em>. Finish the floor and you’ll be able to move on to the next, making your way up the floors until the whole thing’s been fully exorcised.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"gygfrdk5bciebmanej9v\" data-recommend-id=\"image://gygfrdk5bciebmanej9v\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"gygfrdk5bciebmanej9v\" data-recommend-id=\"image://gygfrdk5bciebmanej9v\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Moreover, whoever architected this place took a liberal approach to the concept of “hotel.” While things begin with what you’d expect—the lobby, a restaurant, some guest rooms—you eventually find yourself in a medieval castle and other places I won’t spoil.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">But wait, why is Luigi in a hotel, anyway? It’s because the entire Mario crew has won a complimentary vacation stay there. This includes Mario, Luigi, Peach, and the three major varieties of Toad: Blue, Yellow, and Regular. Five of those people are immediately kidnapped when the hotel reveals its true colors, and it’s up to Luigi to single-handedly rescue them.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Well, <em>double</em>-handedly, as he has a new partner in slime: Gooigi, a replica of himself made entirely out of a mysterious viscous substance. (Who among us, I ask you, would not want this?) Gooigi is a fully-fledged second Luigi who can do almost anything his living counterpart can do, and you can plop him into the playfield at any time by clicking the right stick. Gooigi can pass through grates and pipes, accessing hidden areas or just clearing out lost coins from the sewage lines. Yes, that means that Gooigi actually does something that his dilettante namesake hasn’t in decades: <em>actual plumbing</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Once you unlock Gooigi early in the adventure, you can play through the whole of <em>Luigi’s Mansion 3</em> in two-player co-op if you choose. I played through the whole game on my own, then did a brief co-op test to make sure everything seemed to work. We had no issues with it. The camera automatically zoomed out to try to keep both players on screen, and when they got too far apart, Gooigi just splatted through the floor and popped up again next to Luigi’s position. </p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"xgdpskbf09xwyaygdplf\" data-recommend-id=\"image://xgdpskbf09xwyaygdplf\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"xgdpskbf09xwyaygdplf\" data-recommend-id=\"image://xgdpskbf09xwyaygdplf\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Should you decide to go solo, you’ll still need to use Gooigi often, as many of the game’s puzzles revolve around swapping between both characters. Fire and water will both instantly dissolve Gooigi, which comes into play a lot as you attempt to open up pathways.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Fortunately, you don’t need to rely on Gooigi <em>too</em> much. It would be easy for a developer, having come up with this unique mechanic, to have the entire game be about juggling two different characters, and become tiresome. But for much of the game, Gooigi is optional. You can choose to use him during ghost fights—a particular type of ghost has two tails, and Luigi and Gooigi can each grab one to do double damage—but you’re not forced to in most cases.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Besides his gooey doppelganger, Luigi has a few more moves in the arsenal. The Poltergust G-00 vacuum can suck and blow objects with the L and R triggers, but pressing them both together will cause a big gust of air that shoots Luigi up about a foot into the air and scatters any objects at his feet. He can use the Dark Beam to reveal hidden objects. He can even shoot a plunger (more plumbing!) at objects, which creates a makeshift handle that lets you manipulate otherwise immovable pieces of furniture. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">While the hotel has 15 floors plus a couple basement levels, you’ll only have access to a few of them at first. You’ll collect elevator buttons, usually after fighting a boss, to continue your climb to the penthouse suite and the final confrontation. I didn’t find myself especially antsy to keep climbing the tower, though, because it was fun to wring every last secret out of the floors before moving on. Each floor of the hotel has a unique theming to it, and each room is packed with detail, whether that be hidden passages leading to stashes of cash, puzzles concealing collectible gems, or just funny interactive objects. In one early example, I used the “blow” function of the Poltergust to roll up an area rug, which revealed a secret drain that Gooigi could drip through to find a gem.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"mm0lugutnhxuqwzhilcp\" data-recommend-id=\"image://mm0lugutnhxuqwzhilcp\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"2000\" data-height=\"1125\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"mm0lugutnhxuqwzhilcp\" data-recommend-id=\"image://mm0lugutnhxuqwzhilcp\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"2000\" data-height=\"1125\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">The series’ fundamental mechanic—surprise ghosts with your flashlight, then vacuum them into your Poltergust when they’re stunned—is relatively unchanged here, although once you get a ghost firmly into your suction beam, you can rapidly press the A button to repeatedly body-slam them to the ground and quickly drain their energy and hurt nearby ghosts while you’re at it. You have to flash your beam into a ghost’s eyes before you can start vacuuming, and of course some ghosts protect their eyes in some way or another, so you’ll have to figure out how to do that, first. But it’s all fairly straightforward.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Navigating the hotel itself is the biggest challenge—puzzling through the passages, figuring out how to interact with each room’s assortment of doodads to open the doors blocking the way. I enjoyed that the game was so dense with these puzzles, although I felt like they could have been clued a little better. If the game sees that you’re staring at a puzzle for too long, <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/luigis-latest-parody-nintendo-console-is-the-best-one-y-1839072375\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/luigis-latest-parody-nintendo-console-is-the-best-one-y-1839072375\">Professor E. Gadd will call in</a></span> and tell you what to do next. I considered turning these hints off, but when they came through, my reaction was often “Oh, I don’t think I would have gotten that on my own.” I’d rather have seen some of these puzzles clued in a more organic way versus text-based hints. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Boss fights can be much the same; I would often spend a bit too much time just experimenting with every one of Luigi’s abilities until I found the one that arbitrarily worked to break down the boss’ defenses. In general, though, these fights were always very clever, charming encounters that I enjoyed playing, so it didn’t matter too much in the end.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"a0ayscspvlojigo13o0l\" data-recommend-id=\"image://a0ayscspvlojigo13o0l\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"a0ayscspvlojigo13o0l\" data-recommend-id=\"image://a0ayscspvlojigo13o0l\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">While the Poltergust is built for inhaling the residual spirits of the dead, you’ll spend just as much time sucking up cold, hard cash. I don’t know what criminal enterprise these people were running, but every nook and cranny of this place is stuffed with coins, gold bars, and stacks of greenbacks. Inhaling piles of money and watching your wallet expand is always a joy, although a little bit less so once you realize there’s not a whole lot to spend it on. I was hoping for an upgrade system where I could spend money to do more damage to ghosts or take less damage from them, or unlock new areas with cash, or something along those lines. Instead, you can spend your money on just three things: an item that will revive you once if you run out of health, and two items that let you find the game’s two optional sets of collectibles: hidden Boo ghosts and gems.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">So you don’t strictly <em>need</em> any of the things you can buy, then, although the Boos and gems can be rather tricky to find on one’s own. I collected every cent I could find just for fun, but it was deflating to find that they weren’t worth that much.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\"><em>Luigi’s Mansion 3</em> is not a short game, especially compared to the 3-5 hour length of the original. The time on my game clock when I was done was a solid 17 hours, 40 minutes. That includes some hunting for optional gems, but not much time spent chasing after Boos, and I’m sure I could get another 5 hours out of it if I wanted to cleanse the entire hotel of its secrets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Should you desire more multiplayer than the co-op campaign, <em>Luigi’s Mansion 3</em> has you covered there as well. The “Scarescraper” mode, which can be played either online or via local, multi-Switch play, lets an army of four Luigis take on a series of randomized floors. The goal of each floor could be to capture every ghost, or find all the Toads, or collect a certain amount of cash You can all immediately split up and tackle individual rooms, although you’ll have to come together and cooperate at certain points, like to get through certain doors or if one of you is caught in a trap. </p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Luigi\'s Mansion 3\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">You can press the D-pad to communicate basic phrases like “Over here” or “Help,” although you could also use the Switch’s mobile app to do voice chat. (I loaded up the app to verify that it appeared, but didn’t end up using it.) There are also power-up items scattered liberally around the maps that give you the option to see hidden stuff, flash an entire room full of ghosts at once, et cetera. This, coupled with the strict timer on every floor, makes Scarescraper a more frantic experience.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Finally, there are three mini-games that can be played by up to eight players on a single Switch. These are fairly simple, short, single-round, team-based games that are quite fun but unlikely to be played more than a few times each. (If I’m wrong and a <em>Luigi’s Mansion 3 </em>esports scene develops, I will issue a heartfelt apology.)</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">It’s the sheer variety of experiences in <em>Luigi’s Mansion 3 </em>that keeps it entertaining throughout. While you might at first think you’re in for a repetitive time as you go through the first few floors and find nothing but standard hotel rooms, things get quite unexpected as you continue higher and higher. While it doesn’t reinvent the wheel, it’s a solid take on a series that hasn’t had many entries over the last nearly 20 years. Mostly, it’s just nice to see that Luigi is indeed alive, and not <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/rip-luigi-1983-2018-1828191816\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/rip-luigi-1983-2018-1828191816\">dead</a></span>.</p>', '2024-03-11 11:34:44', '2024-03-11 11:34:44', 'Luigi\'s Mansion 3 Is An Eerie Delight, From The Lobby To The Penthouse', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/gigfzrwragkufvtejnh6.jpg', 'switch', 'https://kotaku.com/luigis-mansion-3-is-an-eerie-delight-from-the-lobby-to-1839360620', 'Why is Luigi still scared of ghosts?

Never before have I lost a 20-minute video game boss battle because my form could have been better in one or two yoga stretches. Never before have I opened an in-game treasure chest by doing squats. Never before have I found anything—not a playlist, not a personal trainer, not a disappointed glance in the mirror—that has made me actually look forward to exercising my core. That last one alone designates <em>Ring Fit Adventure</em> as genius software.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Ring Fit Adventure</em> is a hybrid of a workout routine and a stat- and story-driven video game in which you attack your enemies with exercise. You team up with a talking ring to save the world from evil monsters, some of which are shaped like dumbbells, and you’re going to sweat, at least a little, to save the day. <!-- -->The surprisingly enjoyable Nintendo creation is no gym replacement, but it’s a fascinating experiment that will likely impact users differently depending on their level of fitness. It’s more of a traditional video game than Nintendo’s blockbuster 2008 exercise game <em>Wii Fit</em>. There’s a world map! There’s leveling up! There’s a story! It’s smartly designed with trademark Nintendo ingenuity, while still limited in the way even the best-intentioned home exercise offerings tend to be.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The game is packaged with two key items: a frozen-pizza-sized plastic tension ring into which the player snaps the system’s right Joy-Con controller and a leg strap into which the player slips the left one. The ring can be squeezed and stretched, as the controller’s sensor tracks tension and tilt. That enables the game to challenge you to squeeze the ring overhead to work your deltoids, for example, and to detect if you’ve squeezed, how hard you squeezed, if you’re holding that squeeze and how fast you’re releasing it. The sensors can keep track of your hands during a squat or the tilt of your body as you do a yoga pose while holding the ring. The sensor in the Joy-Con on your leg tracks tilt, which can detect the depth of a squat or your pace as you run in place. It can also track the angle of your thigh and therefore some of the quality of your form as you lay on the floor, ring set aside, doing leg lifts.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The sensors are limited in what they can detect and the exercises they can orchestrate, which makes the game as prone to cheating as any other exercise gear unaccompanied by a well-compensated personal trainer. The game does try to simulate one, at least with animated experts demonstrating good technique and a lot of voicework urging the same. The game’s verbal prompting, not the Joy-Cons’ sensors, is what’ll keep your back straight or your shoulders down or your knees bent as you attempt good form in a given exercise.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">More significantly, the game’s structure—its video-gameness, for lack of a better way of putting it—is its prime motivational tool. Workouts are integrated into a lengthy adventure, which is broken into levels that each involve about a dozen minutes of exercise. Playing those levels involves a mix of running in place, which makes your in-game character run through an obstacle course or outdoor pathway toward a goal, squeezing the ring to shoot bursts of air at destructible boxes and pulling it outward to vacuum coins. (You can switch to a quiet mode that replaces running with knee bends, if you have downstairs neighbors who are sensitive to noise.)</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"wiebxrczjbirohpa4n4z\" data-recommend-id=\"image://wiebxrczjbirohpa4n4z\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"wiebxrczjbirohpa4n4z\" data-recommend-id=\"image://wiebxrczjbirohpa4n4z\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">As you jog through a level, you encounter enemies who pull you into turn-based battles in which you choose specific exercises to use for attacks, drink attack-boosting or health-buffing smoothie power-ups to keep yourself alive and accrue experience points to level up and unlock new exercises. These battles are the part of the game that provide the most rigorous exercise and are engagingly presented as strategic combat in which you’re picking the right exercises to do the most damage. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Proper form helps. If you don’t squat deeply enough or don’t engage your core long enough during a leg lift, you’ll do less damage. This is very much subject to what the sensors can detect and makes the game prone to cheating. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Regardless, clearing a level means narrative progress and the accrual of experience points which will level you up to increase your attack and defense stats.<br></p>\n\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Ring Fit Adventure\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The more you play, the more you unlock new exercises and strategic possibilities. The game is actually motivating its player to target certain muscle groups from workout to workout, but it so effectively works this into the mental process of strategic turn-based combat that I was barely conscious of that as I played. For example, I’m not a person who normally wants to do stomach exercises, but then I played deep enough into <em>Ring Fit Adventure</em> to unlock the ability to target color-coded enemies with color-coded attacks. Suddenly I was looking forward to clearing out yellow enemies with some solid core work. I was eager to get on the floor and do some leg lifts, because I knew they’d do added damage. I wanted to exploit weaknesses and clear the fight.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"nox1bkktcwcxjwdfwyzk\" data-recommend-id=\"image://nox1bkktcwcxjwdfwyzk\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"nox1bkktcwcxjwdfwyzk\" data-recommend-id=\"image://nox1bkktcwcxjwdfwyzk\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In tougher battles, I’ve been motivated to pick exercises that don’t just target color-coded weaknesses but focus on one enemy or target a group. I’ve also started to use boosts, which can give, say, leg-based exercises more potency for a few turns.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"g7esmionknfsx3xfmv40\" data-recommend-id=\"image://g7esmionknfsx3xfmv40\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1269\" data-height=\"708\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"g7esmionknfsx3xfmv40\" data-recommend-id=\"image://g7esmionknfsx3xfmv40\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1269\" data-height=\"708\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">To really get into <em>Ring Fit Adventure</em>, you don’t just need the game, though. You also need the power to not care how ridiculous you will look playing this game. After all, you play a lot of this game by running in place while squeezing a plastic ring. This is not something that will make you look cool.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Play it alone or with understanding spectators and you’re fine. Will you get buff? I’m not sure how effective the workouts in the game can be, if they can significantly sculpt your body rather than simply motivate you to enjoy feeling some burn and getting active each day. I’ve played the game for 10 days, raising the game’s workout difficulty a couple of notches a few days ago. I’ve played more to proceed through the game world than to really knock myself out, and so I’ve generally gotten a light sweat and a little muscle burn from each workout, but, other than when we shot some clips of me playing under hot studio lights, nothing really wiped me out. The moments in each workout when I would run in place to propel my character through a level elevated my pulse a little, but they provided little more labor than a brisk walk. The exercise combat was where I’d find any burn. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">A person’s fitness level will play a big factor in this. I’ve got a small paunch of a belly and I don’t lift weights, but I do run three times a week, about 40 minutes per run, at, according to the Runkeeper app, a 7:33 mile pace so far this year. A couple of minutes of cardio in this game is a breeze for me, but I could certainly use more work on my core, which I’m at least grateful for the game to motivate me to do. It’s one reason I plan to play more and could be one of many fitness goals that <em>Ring Fit </em>could help a player pursue.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"saqy32udazo6n1vrenqy\" data-recommend-id=\"image://saqy32udazo6n1vrenqy\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1273\" data-height=\"707\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"saqy32udazo6n1vrenqy\" data-recommend-id=\"image://saqy32udazo6n1vrenqy\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1273\" data-height=\"707\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The other reason I plan to keep playing <em>Ring Fit Adventure</em> is because I’m a sucker for novel game design. This thing is like no game I’ve experienced before, and I badly want to see how it plays out. What happens when Nintendo’s designers marry exercise to action-adventure video game mechanics? Where does a game like this go?</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The game starts with a silly narrative set-up. You’re a man or woman who finds a talking ring. You’ team up with it to, at least initially, fight a buff dragon who is terrorizing the world. The ring acts mostly as a personal trainer, motivating you through your exercises and making this the most voice-acted game Nintendo has ever put out, for better or worse.

You can’t binge-play a game like this, not without passing out or cheating at the exercises. I’m happier to just play it naturally and marvel at what the game might show me next. I’ve been amused, for example, to see how exercises are used to trigger some simple things. My favorite, so far, is opening a treasure chest with a trio of squats.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"hs2jq8a9ue40secwttgj\" data-recommend-id=\"image://hs2jq8a9ue40secwttgj\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"hs2jq8a9ue40secwttgj\" data-recommend-id=\"image://hs2jq8a9ue40secwttgj\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Where will the story go? How many other outfits can I unlock? Which power-ups must I collect to help me conquer another boss battle? I want to keep playing to find out. That’s a win for the game and for my health, because it means I want to keep exercising.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The cleverness of Nintendo’s design extends beyond the main exercise adventure. A “multi-task” mode tracks squeezes and pulls of the ring while your Nintendo Switch system is in sleep mode, the idea being that you could use the ring for arm workouts while talking to someone on the phone or watching TV. Any exercise you do that way provides a boost the next time you play the game. Nintendo’s designers also utilize the right Joy-Con controller’s infrared sensor to track your pulse after a workout, which, just, wow, that’s really clever, Nintendo.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Ring Fit Adventure </em>is no replacement for just going to the gym or taking up swimming or otherwise thoroughly committing to exercise.

I came to this conclusion recently, while playing the new remake of <em>Link’s Awakening</em> and trying to pinpoint exactly what it is that makes me love <em>Zelda </em>games so much. The answer, I think, is the way Link swings his sword.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Just look:</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"uyyfj9zvrmusc0ccuaqa\" data-recommend-id=\"image://uyyfj9zvrmusc0ccuaqa\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"uyyfj9zvrmusc0ccuaqa\" data-recommend-id=\"image://uyyfj9zvrmusc0ccuaqa\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Is there anything more delightful, more palpably satisfying? The developers at Nintendo have always understood that a video game is only as good as its verbs—its actions—and they’ve always endeavored to make those actions induce as much joy as possible. Over the course of this playthrough of <em>Link’s Awakening</em>, I swung that sword thousands of times, and it never failed to bring me a jolt of happiness as it connected. Look at the way the blade cuts through the air, leaving an arc that almost looks like lightning. Watch how that poor Moblin staggers and flashes a satisfying shade of red. You can’t hear it in a gif, but it sounds delicious, too—an empty whiff when you miss, but a satisfying crunch when you hit. If you told me I could only perform one video game action for the rest of my life, Link’s sword swinging would at least be in the top three. Link’s jumping—not common in <em>Zelda</em> games, but brilliant in <em>Link’s Awakening</em>—might be up there, too.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You know what? Everything you can do in this game feels pretty damn good.<br></p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"The Legend of Zelda: Link\'s Awakening\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\">\n\n</section></aside>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This remake of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</em>, out for Switch on Friday, is a near 1:1 recreation of the 1993 Game Boy game. At the time of its original release,<em> Link’s Awakening</em> was just the fourth game in the <em>Zelda</em> series, a line of games in which you, as a floppy-capped, pointy-eared boy named Link, solve puzzles, fight monsters, and save princesses. <em>Link’s Awakening</em> was a strange game but a wonderful one, and people still rank it among the best entries in a series full of excellent games. Its music, dungeon design, and light but melancholy story have always made it stand out.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Many people coming to this remake will know of it already and want to know how it’s different. Its structure has not changed, but its aesthetics and the conveniences it affords players have.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">For the remake, the developers at Grezzo and Nintendo have re-designed every screen in the world, replacing the old sprites with beautiful painted 3D tableaus that make it feel like you’re looking down on a toy set. The old MIDI soundtrack has transformed into a flowing orchestra, full of woodwinds and choruses. The characters and puzzles remain untouched, but they look very different.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">There are a few other key differences between the original and this remake. First and foremost, you no longer have to waste time juggling items. Every <em>Zelda</em> game gives you a stable of go-to gadgets for fighting monsters and solving puzzles, so it’s helpful when you can access as many as possible at once. The Game Boy version of <em>Link’s Awakening </em>was limited by the system’s two action buttons, A and B, and you had to go into the menu and assign an item to one of those buttons every time you wanted to use it. This included the sword, shield, and even the Power Bracelet, an item that let you pick up rocks, bottles, and other heavy objects. If you wanted to, say, lift a rock and throw it at an enemy, you’d need to open your inventory, select the Power Bracelet, swap it in with one of your equipped items, and then press that button next to the rock. It wasn’t hard to get used to this system, but it was tedious.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Fortunately, the Switch has a lot more buttons than the Game Boy, and the designers of the <em>Link’s Awakening </em>remake have taken advantage. Your sword and shield now have dedicated buttons, as do the Pegasus Boots, an item you’ll get early in the game that lets Link dash at super-speed. You no longer have to equip the Power Bracelet to pick up rocks. You just have to own it. These changes might sound minor, but they make a huge difference, and this version of <em>Link’s Awakening</em> feels like it belongs in 2019.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The other big difference is the addition of a side feature—Chamber Dungeons—which is boring and tedious. It’s an optional mode in which you can take rooms from dungeons you’ve already beaten and rearrange them using layouts provided by the <em>Zelda </em>stalwart Dampé the gravedigger. Unless you enjoy playing through the same rooms over and over again, it’s just a big waste of time. (Read <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/zelda-link-s-awakenings-chamber-dungeons-are-a-big-dis-1838038985\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/zelda-link-s-awakenings-chamber-dungeons-are-a-big-dis-1838038985\">more about Chamber Dungeons here</a></span>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">There are a handful of smaller tweaks, too. You can save and then re-load the game from anywhere. You can catch fairies in bottles. The fast travel warp points are more frequent and easier to use. Unlike the Game Boy version, <em>Link’s Awakening</em> on Switch has a few notable framerate issues. While walking around the overworld—which, rather than a grid of single-screen rooms, is now a continuous map—I ran into some choppiness. (I played the game entirely in handheld mode.)</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">What hasn’t changed is everything that made <em>Link’s Awakening</em> work so well in 1993, all of which holds up today: the locations, the puzzles, and most importantly, the moment-to-moment satisfaction of smacking slimes in the face with a boomerang.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Some quick history. Back in 1987, <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> blew people away with its promise of what an open-world video game could look like. It encouraged exploration and instilled a feeling of adventure unlike anything we’d seen on the NES before, but it was very shallow, like a blueprint for what <em>Zelda</em> could look like in the future. Its sequel, the black sheep <em>Zelda II: Adventure of Link</em>, experimented with sidescrolling action to mixed results. It wasn’t until 1991 that the <em>Zelda</em> formula first emerged with <em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</em>, the game that established conventions that would be used for many years to come. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Like the original <em>Zelda</em>, <em>Link to the Past </em>dropped you into an open world with little but your wits and the sword in your hand, but unlike the first game’s flat layouts and simple topography, <em>Link to the Past</em> was dense. Different areas of the world had different themes, almost personalities, like the swampy Misery Mire and the chilly Kakariko Village. Rather than ask you to walk through a series of indistinguishable flat maps as the NES game did, <em>Link to the Past </em>was full of elaborate mazes and tangled designs. The world bulged with secrets, and around every corner you’d find a hidden chest or cracked wall to blow up. Your options would be limited to a few areas at first, and over time, as you acquired more items—the Power Gloves, the flippers, the hookshot—you’d be able to access more and more of the world. Backtracking to old areas would reward you with cool stuff, like item upgrades and pieces of heart. </p>\n\n<aside class=\"sc-1rh3ayr-6 htdlpl inset--story branded-item branded-item--kotaku\" data-commerce-source=\"inset\"><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-1rh3ayr-2 bmhLPh inset--story__thumb js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Permalink page click\",\"Permalink page click - inset photo\"]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/zelda-link-s-awakenings-chamber-dungeons-are-a-big-dis-1838038985\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\n<span class=\"sc-ynl58c-0 jbNKBA\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" aria-label=\"Kotaku avatar\" viewbox=\"0 0 64 64\"><g fill=\"none\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\"><path fill=\"#FBC000\" d=\"M0 0h64v64H0z\"></path><path fill=\"#FFF\" d=\"M16.8 49.62l3.67-.14c4.05-.15 7.76-3.2 8.35-6.78l4.13-24.65-10.3-.3-5.84 31.87zM43.19 29.1c3.57.02 4.95 1.29 5.93 3.27l6.84 16.84c-1.73 1.54-9.79 1-12.08-5.04l-2.5-6.72h-1.15c-3.8.06-9.2-2.78-8.03-8.4l11 .05zm-22.2-11.38l-5.59-.16c-7.78-.22-9.93 5.3-9.28 8.88l13.26.13 1.6-8.85zm31.55 7.69c2.62-1.66 3.74-7.65 1.9-9.4l-13.51 3.4c-2.3 1.28-4.94 5.01-2.33 9.15l13.94-3.15z\"></path></g></svg></span></a></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Link’s Awakening</em> started off as an experiment to remake the <em>Link to the Past</em> on the Game Boy, according to an interview with <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://archive.fo/20120629063241/http://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/news/iwata/iwata_asks_-_zelda_handheld_history_15603_15604.html\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://archive.fo/20120629063241/http://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/news/iwata/iwata_asks_-_zelda_handheld_history_15603_15604.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the game’s original developers</a></span>. Soon it had evolved into something much weirder. Taking influences from sources ranging from <em>Mario </em>to <em>Twin Peaks</em>, the developers filled their world with quirky characters and a variety of locations: magically enhanced forests, cactus-infested deserts, mazes full of bushes and deadly holes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The game starts off at some indeterminate point in Link’s life. Our hero is sailing through a nasty storm when suddenly everything goes dark. He winds up on a beach, where he’s rescued and taken to safety by a girl named Marin who has a beautiful voice and a magnetic appeal to cute animals, like a chibi Disney princess. Turns out that Link is on a mysterious island called Koholint that’s full of strange people, talking animals, and a whole lot of references to Nintendo’s <em>Super Mario</em> series. A talking owl sends Link on a mission to go wake up the Wind Fish, a godlike creature who lives in a giant egg in the center of the island. Soon he’s off on a journey to go find eight instruments in eight dungeons across the world.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Like <em>Link to the Past</em>’s Hyrule, the world of <em>Link’s Awakening</em> is dense and full of mysteries. It starts off feeling constrained, limiting you to a handful of areas thanks to obstacles like heavy rocks and bottomless pits. The more you play, the more you’ll break down those barriers. By the time you’ve hit your stride and explored enough of the map to see how it all fits together, you may appreciate its intricacy, as if you’ve just cracked open a mechanical watch and learned what makes it tick. In the Game Boy version, the world map was broken up into 256 screens, most of which had their own gimmicks or secrets. The Switch version links them together in one large world map. Both styles are appealing, but the latter is easier to get around, and it’s a delight to see how it all weaves together.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Link’s Awakening</em>’s eight dungeons each follow a traditional pattern, blending puzzles with navigational challenges and obstacles that you’ll need that dungeon’s item to overcome. One puzzle might task you with killing three enemies in the right order; another might involve maneuvering a floating block until it fills every gap in the floor. None of these challenges or puzzles are particularly complicated. Usually they’re just subversive enough to stymie the <em>first</em> solution you think of, but the second will work. Still, completing them is usually satisfying, and the themes grow more interesting as you go. The seventh, Eagle’s Tower, has one of the more memorable gimmicks of any <em>Zelda</em> dungeon to date. The optional ninth Color Dungeon, added for the Game Boy Color version of the game in 1998 and retained for this Switch remake, is actually the weakest of them all, which may come as a disappointment to anyone who played the original and was hoping for something brand new.</p>\n<aside class=\"sc-1rh3ayr-6 htdlpl inset--story branded-item branded-item--kotaku\" data-commerce-source=\"inset\"><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-1rh3ayr-2 bmhLPh inset--story__thumb js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Permalink page click\",\"Permalink page click - inset photo\"]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-the-kotaku-rev-1792885174\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\n<span class=\"sc-ynl58c-0 jbNKBA\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" aria-label=\"Kotaku avatar\" viewbox=\"0 0 64 64\"><g fill=\"none\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\"><path fill=\"#FBC000\" d=\"M0 0h64v64H0z\"></path><path fill=\"#FFF\" d=\"M16.8 49.62l3.67-.14c4.05-.15 7.76-3.2 8.35-6.78l4.13-24.65-10.3-.3-5.84 31.87zM43.19 29.1c3.57.02 4.95 1.29 5.93 3.27l6.84 16.84c-1.73 1.54-9.79 1-12.08-5.04l-2.5-6.72h-1.15c-3.8.06-9.2-2.78-8.03-8.4l11 .05zm-22.2-11.38l-5.59-.16c-7.78-.22-9.93 5.3-9.28 8.88l13.26.13 1.6-8.85zm31.55 7.69c2.62-1.66 3.74-7.65 1.9-9.4l-13.51 3.4c-2.3 1.28-4.94 5.01-2.33 9.15l13.94-3.15z\"></path></g></svg></span></a></aside>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">And there is nothing brand new to the main adventure here. <em>Link’s Awakening</em> is a beautiful recreation of a legendary game, but it doesn’t have much to offer to players who already know the ins and outs of Koholint Island.

Here is another way to describe it: the worst filler episode of your favorite anime series. It is a mess of a game, with a story mode chock full of unintelligible cutscenes, repetitious anime tropes, and a core of mech gameplay that is highly customizable but starts to blend together due to repetitive gameplay and drawn out gunfights.<br></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong><em>This piece was first published on September 11, 2019. We’re bumping it today for the game’s release.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The Switch exclusive is a third-person action game in which you pilot an Arsenal, a weaponized mech. You spend time customizing your mech’s appearance and loadout, and then you accept missions from an AI called Four on behalf of mercenary supergroup Orbital. The missions are largely repetitive: fight some AI, or protect a building by fighting some AI. As you continue to increase your rank, you might fight some AI and other mercenaries, or protect a transport vehicle by fighting some AI and other mercenaries. Those fights drag on just a little too long for how samey they are. While I enjoyed moments like finding an acid gun that cut right through my enemies’ health, or double fisting bazookas every now and again to be silly, most of the guns felt a little bit too weak and dull even as I completed missions and upgraded them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The game occasionally shakes things up with a gigantic mech boss that dwarfs you in size, which adds some desperately needed variety and is the real core of the game’s fun. One encounter has you facing a huge spider-like mech that jumps around the battlefield and tries to crush you as you maneuver to aim for its weak underbelly. Another has you fighting a tanker aircraft with lasers that tries to ram you between charged shots. These encounters are far more fun than fighting other pilots, which at a certain point begins to feel like aimlessly firing bullets into an endless morass of enemy health. It doesn’t help that the game’s lock-on system feels a little bit too fast and loose, even after optimizing your build.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The gameplay is fine, with flashes of fun, but isn’t good enough to outweigh <em>Daemon X Machina</em>’s storytelling problems. The game fills the checklist of anime cliches and is dense with forgettable terms and aggravating characters who say things such as: “I’m big bad Gargantua, twerp! I don’t need no details! Let me get to wreckin’ already!” Your created character is a Reclaimer, a very diplomatic way of describing a group of mercenaries who pilot mechs to essentially resolve territory disputes in a resource-rich area called Oval. Complicating this task is a war with rogue AI beings called Immortals, or at least, that’s what the game tells you.</p>\n\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Daemon X Machina\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\">\n\n</section></aside>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In reality, after a certain point, <em>Daemon X Machina </em>shifts to a formula that is at once comically predictable and frustratingly oblique: You have a standard mission to destroy rogue AI machines. At some point, you and your mercenary allies are shocked—every time!— to find that another group of Orbital mercenaries has a mission that directly opposes yours. Again and again and again.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The game goes so far out of its way to tease its secret sci-fi plot that it never actually gets far enough into what’s actually happening to stay interesting. What are the Immortals <em>really</em>? What is each mercenary group’s aim? Which political consortium is doing what? Instead of getting a sufficient explanation for this, you spend rank after rank of the game getting an agonizing drip feed of troped-up anime quotes and characters who someone desperately tried to make mysterious but just come off corny and poorly written. “I know a thing,” they essentially say, “but I cannot tell you the thing yet. Just watch your back, Rookie.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"mm0x8covwus47zszqta6\" data-recommend-id=\"image://mm0x8covwus47zszqta6\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"961\" data-height=\"540\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"mm0x8covwus47zszqta6\" data-recommend-id=\"image://mm0x8covwus47zszqta6\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"961\" data-height=\"540\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The game <em>very badly</em> wants to impart to you, the Rookie (and bafflingly the only pilot who continues unaffiliated for a substantial portion of the game), that each group has their own reasons to fight. And each pilot has their own reasons to fight. And that these pilots all understand that other pilots have their reasons to fight. There are sincerely dozens of cutscenes and chats and mid-mission dialogue options about reasons to fight. For some of them, it’s money, which in this game means <em>several</em> “they better pay more for this” jokes that quickly stop being funny. There are also several pilots who tell you, “Just don’t get in my way,” or some variation thereof.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Supplementing mid-battle chatter are between-mission messages from outside characters and groups, which are intended to worldbuild and provide background but are so poorly written they just come off silly. Each political consortium ends up sounding like an overwrought supervillain stroking a cat, making it difficult to distinguish them. “While this situation has been entrusted to Orbital, we believe it will be difficult for them to address it through the...proper means,” writes consortium Horizon, and I couldn’t help wondering why this message was even being sent to my character in the first place. Is this a mass email? Will I die in seven days if I don’t forward it? There’s a certain level at which the weird, stilted nature of communicating with Four and these consortiums seems intentional, but I just ended up frustrated with the game’s forced sense of mystique.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"vjfwdgdbgathvtgaqqn8\" data-recommend-id=\"image://vjfwdgdbgathvtgaqqn8\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"vjfwdgdbgathvtgaqqn8\" data-recommend-id=\"image://vjfwdgdbgathvtgaqqn8\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">By the time you finally get the scent of some plot advancement at the end of your C-rank missions (you start at E), the game has tangled itself in confusing situations with characters you don’t have context to care about as they act on motivations and feelings that are hinted at but don’t actually seem to exist in any meaningful way. That confusion continues through to the end of the game, where the exposition dumping continues to ramp up. As the story unfolds, some compelling ideas about artificial intelligence and narrative twists actually emerge, but they’re both sparse and tardy. There could have been a genuinely interesting story here, had it been told with more care.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">As a person who loves worldbuilding and lore, it’s hard for me to say that you should just skip the cutscenes and play the missions, but…you should probably just skip the cutscenes and play the missions. Since I’m a longtime player of Japanese RPGs, getting me to throw my hands up in the air and ask for fewer cutscenes is a feat.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"iqpoj9icnajx9rpvimmj\" data-recommend-id=\"image://iqpoj9icnajx9rpvimmj\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"iqpoj9icnajx9rpvimmj\" data-recommend-id=\"image://iqpoj9icnajx9rpvimmj\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The gameplay, unfortunately, is hurt by the same tendency toward excess that wrecks <em>Daemon X Machina</em>’s story. A lot of what I was able to do with my mech felt superfluous. There are different configurations you can use, like an offensive option or a speedier option, each with lowered defense, and you also have the ability to make a “Mirage,” a clone of yourself that draws enemies in and fights alongside you. These options can be helpful, particularly the Mirage, but they feel jammed into a game that already has a <em>lot</em> of stuff you can play with. There are also moments where you have to pilot equipment that’s not your own, including a gigantic Immortal that would be cool if it weren’t slow with limited tools. It sort of feels like a “this is the mech game you <em>could</em> be stuck with” moment, but it lasts for way too long.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Between fights, you can use equipment you’ve looted on missions to customize your Arsenal. You can also buy equipment or trade in parts to have new armor and weapons developed, as well as adding attachment to these parts, like increased ammo power or lowered memory usage. There are a lot of ways to customize both your Arsenal and the parts that make it up, but the gear you collect is unexciting and doesn’t feel worthwhile to min-max. On top of that, I found myself more than once wondering why I couldn’t just have certain abilities I could find or enhance.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"ixd9hz28zcjmszte859s\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ixd9hz28zcjmszte859s\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1279\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"ixd9hz28zcjmszte859s\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ixd9hz28zcjmszte859s\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1279\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">For example, I could deal with the fact that I essentially had to be on top of enemies to aim at them at first, but having to use an equipment slot for a downward boost was irksome. The only other way to descend without it was to just slowly fall from the sky. I started to feel like a hoarder as a bunch of barely distinguishable parts piled up in my Arsenal’s arsenal, scarcely making enough of a difference for the mixing and matching to go as deep as all the in-game stats imply. I didn’t get excited about new decals or paint options, either, though at least there’s a hotdog decal. I’m never in life going to put that shit on my actual mech, but I’m tickled and happy that it exists.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You can also customize your pilot, or Outer, who can actually run around outside of a mech on the battlefield. It’s rarely fun to run around on foot, though you can eventually gain a skill to repair your mech. There are also some missions that require you to run around without your mech, like one where you have to stealthily steal an Arsenal and escape. They’re fine. They don’t feel totally broken and out of place, but they also aren’t a real highlight.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"lafnp7hanpjtevjbr2mi\" data-recommend-id=\"image://lafnp7hanpjtevjbr2mi\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"548\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"lafnp7hanpjtevjbr2mi\" data-recommend-id=\"image://lafnp7hanpjtevjbr2mi\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"548\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">These issues are less pronounced in co-op, which has its own set of missions you can play with up to three other players. These missions consist of fighting versions of bosses you encounter in the main campaign, from gigantic mechs to other Arsenals. It was fun and challenging, and I could easily see multiplayer being the real draw of the game, though the limited number of missions could get old fast. I’m not sure the game is complex enough for strategy to figure much into the co-op gameplay, but it could be fun to team with friends to fire bullets and acid and lasers into a big ol’ mechanical monster.<br></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I wanted to like <em>Daemon X Machina</em>, but as I played, I kept wondering how much more fun it might have been if the developers had zeroed in on some of the more enjoyable elements instead of providing so many customization options and wrapping everything in such a convoluted story. There are some genuine bright spots in the gameplay and even some enjoyably ridiculous characters, but there’s honestly just too much of…everything. It should be a good problem to have, but in a world that’s changing for good, Marvelous never truly figured out what they were fighting for.</p>', '2024-03-11 11:34:44', '2024-03-11 11:34:44', 'Daemon X Machina: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/pi6r75v4zh5cqjnnkhja.jpg', 'switch', 'https://kotaku.com/daemon-x-machina-the-kotaku-review-1838032306', 'Daemon X Machina, out September 13 from Marvelous, is a game about gigantic cust...', ''),

That’s what its developer <em>Platinum Games</em> calls it. That’s what we called it when we first reported on its existence. But <em>Astral Chain</em> is so much more than just an action game. I’d go as far as saying that “action game” is the <em>least</em> of what <em>Astral Chain</em> is.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong><em>This piece was first published on August 26, 2019. We’re bumping it today for the game’s release.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Stylish action is what we’ve come to expect from Platinum Games. It’s the Osaka-based studio’s bread and butter. Whether it’s highly stylized original work like <em>Bayonetta, Nier: Automata</em>, and <em>Vanquish</em> or licensed games like <em>The Legend of Korra</em> and <em>Transformers Devastation</em>, much of Platinum’s work is built on a strong foundation of action combat. The style is fast and flashy, with gorgeous animation and special effects, while still being technical and deep, with timed dodges and parries and counters. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I anticipated such combat in <em>Astral Chain</em>, and I was not disappointed. I was, however, surprised to discover that while fighting is the foundation of <em>Astral Chain</em>, Platinum has built such a rich and storied world upon that foundation that the battles often take a back seat to the non-ass-kicking portions of the game. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">There is no dearth of ass to be kicked in the apocalyptic world of 2078. On the brink of extinction, the last remnants of humanity have retreated to the Ark, a fortified megacity built atop a man-made island. But humanity can’t catch a break, and finds itself set upon by Chimera, creatures from the astral plane who kidnap citizens and spread crimson corruption. The world’s last hope is a special police force known as Neuron. Neuron has figured out how to capture and harness the power of the Chimera, transforming them into Legions, living weapons bound to human operators through chains of an astral variety. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"wavqto6aak1lzbviapwf\" data-recommend-id=\"image://wavqto6aak1lzbviapwf\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1234\" data-height=\"655\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"wavqto6aak1lzbviapwf\" data-recommend-id=\"image://wavqto6aak1lzbviapwf\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1234\" data-height=\"655\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"> The game opens with a set of twin orphans, brother and sister, recruited into the Neuron ranks. Depending one which of the pair the player selects, one will be the main character with a name of the player’s choosing, and the other will be a non-playable character called Akira. When disaster strikes and the majority of Neuron loses the ability to control Legions, this twosome becomes the last hope of the last hope, running point on missions to investigate Chimera activity, rescue citizens captured by enemy forces, and investigate threats both alien and human. Being on the brink of extinction does strange things to people.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"e9g8bnejamaciptpzqzi\" data-recommend-id=\"image://e9g8bnejamaciptpzqzi\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"e9g8bnejamaciptpzqzi\" data-recommend-id=\"image://e9g8bnejamaciptpzqzi\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">From that basic premise, <em>Astral Chain</em>’s narrative slowly unfolds over the course of 11 chapters, here called “files.” A powerful villain emerges, threatening to undo all the good work Neuron has done. Exactly how “good” said work is eventually comes into question. The mystery of the Chimera creatures plaguing humanity is explored. There are a couple of surprises in the game’s story, twists that caught me off-guard, but nothing too convoluted. It’s an anime-style game with an anime premise and anime-quality writing.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"jvipve7ozliwmxzpibuz\" data-recommend-id=\"image://jvipve7ozliwmxzpibuz\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"jvipve7ozliwmxzpibuz\" data-recommend-id=\"image://jvipve7ozliwmxzpibuz\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Satisfying combat and a well-crafted story are all a basic action game needs. Throw in gorgeous characters designed by manga artist Masakazu Katsura<em> </em>and a slapping soundtrack and you’re done. But again, <em>Astral Chain</em> is more than a basic action game. The fighting and fiction are <em>Astral Chain</em>’s skeleton, functional yet bony and pokey. Platinum Games has layered that sturdy frame with oodles of soft and squishy world-building, adventure-style investigative gameplay, and all sorts of optional mechanics allowing players to fiddle with fashion, take photos, or get to know their non-player allies better. It’s a plush layer of padding that turns a serviceable action game into a fully-fleshed out action-adventure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Here’s how the average file in <em>Astral Chain</em> plays out. Players start off in Neuron Headquarters, a four-story fortress outfitted with a helipad, motorpool, research and development lab, medical office, training simulator, restrooms, and more. It also houses the main operations room, from which Neuron officers are deployed on life-and-death missions, but that’s for later. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I like to kick things off by talking to every non-player character in the office. Some of them will chit-chat. Others will have optional missions, like delivering an item to another character or carrying a teetering stack of supplies to their destination. As I talk to everyone I make sure to take photos of them all with the in-game camera, because taking pictures unlocks character bios, giving me important details and backstory. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"jsceyabber2pa8oworh4\" data-recommend-id=\"image://jsceyabber2pa8oworh4\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"jsceyabber2pa8oworh4\" data-recommend-id=\"image://jsceyabber2pa8oworh4\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Then I check the Orders menu. Orders are tasks players can perform that reward them with upgrade or cosmetic items. Completing game files, putting points into the talent trees of my collection of Legion weapons, performing side quests—all of these actions unlock rewards. There’s even a set of Orders that ask me to take pictures of certain characters and places using the aforementioned in-game camera.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Speaking of upgrades, I then head down to R&amp;D to use material rewarded or gathered while out in the field to upgrade my baton and my Legatus, the device used to control Legions. The baton is a weapon that can transform between a quick staff, a slow and powerful blade, or a ranged pistol. It’s very handy. I generally pop into the Legion upgrade menu while in R&amp;D as well, unlocking and assigning skills for my captured creatures. While the player starts with just one Legion, eventually they gain access to five, each with their own unique abilities and fighting styles, so it pays to stay on top of upgrades. </p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"imd4bi2znk6uwlrv5k4x\" data-recommend-id=\"image://imd4bi2znk6uwlrv5k4x\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"imd4bi2znk6uwlrv5k4x\" data-recommend-id=\"image://imd4bi2znk6uwlrv5k4x\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I stop by the locker room to change clothes, one of my favorite things to do in a video game. <em>Astral Chain</em> features a nice selection of clothing items and color schemes to customize the player character. There are hats, glasses, masks, and more. I can change my character’s hair style and color as I please. I spend a lot of time in the locker room.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Eventually, I head to the roof or the garage to deploy on whatever urgent mission I was briefed on when the file began. It’s just that there are so many other activities to participate in, and I don’t want to miss anything. </p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"nc7remthbjhltfyddfuc\" data-recommend-id=\"image://nc7remthbjhltfyddfuc\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"nc7remthbjhltfyddfuc\" data-recommend-id=\"image://nc7remthbjhltfyddfuc\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The distractions from battle continue once deployed to the sprawling streets, sewers, and slums that make up the Ark. The last bastion of humanity is colorful and teeming with life. People walk the streets bathed in the glow from neon signs, because we’ll stop buying shit when we’re extinct, dammit. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The citizens of the Ark are witnesses who help Neuron with investigations, providing important keywords and phrases for our police cluebooks. Many of the game’s files involve an element of detective work, tracking down enemies or rifts to the astral plane before getting around to the fighting. Citizens are also a source of side missions, further distracting players from the combat that many assumed the game was all about. </p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Astral Chain\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Even when deep inside the astral plane, the home realm of the bizarre creatures seemingly hell-bent on our destruction, there’s more to do than just fighting. The crimson-colored astral plane is a convoluted space, filled with secrets to discover and obstacles to be overcome by clever use of each Legion’s special abilities. The Arrow Legion can activate switches from afar. My very special pupper, the doglike Beast Legion, can track scents, dig up buried objects, and act as a mount when the player needs to go fast. The Arm Legion, named for its massive appendages, can open heavy doors, slide blocks, and maneuver platforms. Expeditions into the astral plane are as much about puzzle-solving as they are fighting Chimera.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I guess we should talk about this action game’s action. It’s quite nice. As the player character I swap between my baton’s basic, heavy sword, and gun modes, dealing damage near and far, fast and slow as I see fit. I dodge enemies’ attacks. I counterattack. By myself, battles are a bit basic. But I am hardly ever alone in <em>Astral Chain</em>. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">While I battle, my chosen Legion battles as well, attacking with sword slashes, claws, arrows, punches, and mighty axe swings, as applicable. With the press of a button I can send them charging at a specific enemy. With another press I can follow them, doing damage to all enemies in my path. I can hold down the left trigger on the Joy-Con and directly control my Legion, wrapping them around enemies so the chain connecting us binds them in place. If my Legion and I are placed correctly we can lariat certain charging enemies with the chain, sending them flying as if launched by a slingshot. It’s fast and frantic and highly enjoyable. Not so enjoyable that I miss it when battles end and I’m back to exploring and investigating, but enough that I’m never frustrated when enemies appear.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Looking back now that I’ve finished the game, there’s not really all that much fighting in <em>Astral Chain</em>. There are plenty of small, short battles and quite a few fights against massive, creepy-looking bosses monsters. I’m not saying that fans of Platinum Games’ signature action will be disappointed. I’m just saying that more than half of the 18 hours I spent completing the game was spent exploring, solving puzzles, taking screenshots, collecting cats, and occasionally dressing up as a Neuron’s quirky dog mascot.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"nnglglryqkxrbapzq47y\" data-recommend-id=\"image://nnglglryqkxrbapzq47y\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"nnglglryqkxrbapzq47y\" data-recommend-id=\"image://nnglglryqkxrbapzq47y\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I came into <em>Astral Chain</em> expecting a nice action game with a pleasant anime aesthetic, a a scoop of ice cream with a cherry on top. Platinum Games gave me a giant sundae piled high with whipped cream and sliced fruit and chocolate sauce. And nuts. Pecans. Love those pecans. What I wanted is there, and it’s good.

Edelgard, the successor to the Adrestian Empire, is the only one who seems to have really grappled with what being a leader will mean, and it has made her cold. Dimitri, future king of the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus, is prim and proper, but his first brush with an actual battle leaves him furious about the loss of life. Claude, who will someday lead the mercantile republic that is the Leicester Alliance, has his eyes on a much bigger picture and hides his schemes behind laughs and smiles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">By the time the game is finished, only one of these teenagers will succeed. Which one prevails relies on your player character, who is named Byleth by default. She dreams of ancient wars and an amnesiac girl whose connection to Byleth is shrouded in mystery. Byleth has been enlisted as a professor at the Garreg Mach monastery, where he or she teaches one of three houses: the Blue Lions, the Golden Deer, or the Black Eagles. I went with the Golden Deer after being charmed by Claude’s easygoing nature.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The political struggles of each region of Fódlan are as much characters in this story as the plucky teenagers who will someday clash on the battlefield. The history of Fódlan and its primary religion, the Church of Seiros, is deep and intricate. That I can recite all the names of these places by memory—as well as the names of their ruling families—speaks to how thoroughly engrossed I was in this political conflict. While there is some fantasy nonsense going on in the latter half of <em>Three Houses</em>, it’s mostly a story of people and their competing desires. It also shows how those competing desires, when enacted by large political powers, can devastate everything in their path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Take Cyril, a student-age refugee who lives and works in Garreg Mach rather than studying there. He doesn’t want to get close to the students around him. Soon, they’ll leave the monastery, but he will still be there, cleaning up after the messes of another group of privileged kids. That they are even in the same place at the same time is an accident—in Cyril’s mind, they still inhabit wholly different worlds. Or take Dedue, Dimitri’s right hand man. He’s originally from Duscur, a formerly allied nation that was razed after they betrayed and killed the king and queen of Faerghus, Dimitri’s parents. While the people of Fódlan generally distrust people from Duscur, Dimitri speaks to Dedue like a friend and an equal. Thus Dedue has devoted his life to serving him as ably as he can, even if it means leading the kind of indiscriminate slaughter that obliterated his homeland.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It isn’t just the writing that’s sharp in <em>Three Houses</em>. The always good tactical gameplay has been honed to a finely tuned edge with turn-based combat that captures the plate-spinning chaos of commanding of an army. Each encounter is a puzzle where the goal is to get everyone through to the end alive. In Casual mode, where characters don’t permanently die, you can take more risks, although I tried to make sure everyone made it out alive anyway—battles get much tougher when you’re low on allies. In Classic mode, which has permadeath, protecting my band of teenagers was paramount. What kind of teacher would I be if I let my children die?</p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Fire Emblem: Three Houses\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Luckily, in <em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</em>, you get the power to rewind time using the Divine Pulse. Mapped to the left trigger, it allows you to rewind as far as you’d like in a battle when you activate it. You’ll start out with limited uses, though you’ll earn more by the end of the game. It doesn’t drastically figure into the strategy  beyond acting as an alternative for save scumming, but it does teach you how to play smarter.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In one particular battle, I used it to retry the same turn three times. I was trying to push myself to kill a particular low-health enemy unit before the end of the turn and keep all my characters alive in the process. In my first attempt, I had to leave one of my units out in the open, where they got ganged up on and died. It didn’t matter which character I left out there; they were destined to die unless I figured out a new strategy. So instead, I pulled back, leading that one low-health enemy to me and drawing in the farther units. The unit I had been trying to kill attacked one of my characters and then died in the counterattack. Because the other three units that had been killing my characters were closer to the whole group now, I took them out easily.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">There’s enough variance in enemy types and maps that each battlefield is a wholly different challenge. Some maps have scorching hot spots that damage characters. Others are cloaked in fog, and you can only see enemies when they’re close to you. As the game goes on, you’ll see more mounted, flying, and heavily armored units on the battlefield, making you utilize every character’s skills to take them down. You even fight giant demonic beasts who have devastating attacks and much more health than other enemies. You’ll never be able to rely on one powerful character to make it through combat unscathed. You have to learn how to get everyone working harmoniously—to use an archer to chip away at a unit’s health so that a lancer can come through with the finishing blow.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Instrumental to figuring out this harmony is the time spent in Garreg Mach, where you teach your students and make them more effective in combat. Skills build over time during battle, but in the teaching phase of the game, you can speed that along or even foster new skills. Lorenz started out as a lance user, but on a whim I taught him some Reason, which is one of the two kinds of magic in <em>Three Houses</em>. Turns out he is an absolute beast as a magician, and by the end I had made him a Dark Knight, riding around the battlefield and setting people on fire. Although some units will always feel more effective with certain weapons over others—try as I might, the bookish Ignatz always hit harder with a bow than a sword—there’s still a surprising amount of customizability.<br></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In that way, the gameplay in <em>Three Houses</em> feeds into the story elegantly. As is now customary in the series, characters who help each other on the battlefield can unlock support conversations that build out their personalities and the world they inhabit. By having Marianne, a shrinking violet who doesn’t talk to anyone if she can help it, pair up with Lorenz, a haughty noble who passes the time by looking for a wife worthy of his station, you see new sides of them. Lorenz thinks Marianne is perfect just as she is, even though Marianne wishes she could change her temperament. She learns confidence from him, and through that, you see a side of Lorenz that isn’t completely obnoxious. After completing their support conversations, they’ll be more powerful when placed next to each other in combat. There are other ways to build support, too. Most of them are in Garreg Mach, where you can dine with students, fish, garden, and shop, among other activities. By the end of the game, I knew its layout by heart and even had a favorite spot to hang out (by the greenhouse, looking out on the water).<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Even after finishing the game, I can’t get my mind off Garreg Mach. I immediately started two new saves—one for each of the houses I hadn’t played. The characters are engrossing, the combat is pitch perfect, and the world feels fully developed, like it’s still hiding some mysteries I have yet to untangle.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 rlnFM align--center js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"jgal38yoam9dr43i7pdp\" data-recommend-id=\"image://jgal38yoam9dr43i7pdp\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"67\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"jgal38yoam9dr43i7pdp\" data-recommend-id=\"image://jgal38yoam9dr43i7pdp\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"67\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">At one point in <em>Three Houses</em>, Claude tells Byleth that he feels like he’s watching history being written. The students at Garreg Mach slowly begin to feel a sense of malaise as time marches on—their futures get murkier, and their attitudes turn darker. I found myself all the more engrossed for the parallels I saw with my feelings about the real world during a time of intense political upheaval. It feels like watching a boulder roll downhill, barreling into a future I can’t control.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But in <em>Three Houses</em>, everyone knows that what they’re doing is worth it. It isn’t pretty or easy, and it comes with more than its share of heartbreak. But it <em>is</em> worth it: to fight, to resist, to push for a better world. In <em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</em>, Dimitri, Edelgard, and Claude all envision a future for Fódlan that’s radically different from the one they live in. By the end of the game, one of their dreams will be realized. It’s nice to spend time in a world where that’s not only certain, but believable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>Editor’s note: 7/25/19, 11:55 a.m. ET:</strong> This story has been updated with new language regarding the game’s premise.</p>', '2024-03-11 11:34:44', '2024-03-11 11:34:44', 'Fire Emblem: Three Houses: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/uyehsthmvu18lxq0xmfd.jpg', 'switch', 'https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-three-houses-the-kotaku-review-1836675912', 'Fire Emblem: Three Houses is a game for interesting times.\nAt the start, none of...', '');

Then my perpetually indecisive brain freaks out about whether the game I spent 100 hours playing was actually any good, the tension between an interesting game and a fun one, and the cries of all the games I never finished or even got around to starting, still begging for my attention.<br></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I spent 2023 tracking some of the best new games <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://twitter.com/ethangach/status/1730609548300320796\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://twitter.com/ethangach/status/1730609548300320796\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">that came out every month</a></span>, attempting to at least try as many of them as I could while also measuring how my feelings changed about them as the year went on. And I ended up playing a bunch of them while still not getting around to what no doubt would have been strong personal GOTY contenders. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">With a not-so-short short list assembled by early December, the task then becomes figuring out which games I actually thought were the best. I’ve worked hard to convince myself over the years that the process is more art than science. Inevitably I tally up the perceived merits and flaws of a game and then try to compare the vague calculations, an exercise that always ends in a mix of conflicted self-doubt and second-guessing.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Eventually I silence the internal dissent and retreat into a more abstract sense of what feels right. Recently this has meant giving in more to my personal tastes and subjectivity, championing the games I love rather than the ones I feel I ought to like, and praising them for the one or two things they do very well instead of letting all the smaller things they don’t do so well hold them back. This doesn’t impose any more order on the chaos of comparing a roguelite loot shooter to a visual novel adventure, but it does give me fewer pangs of guilt when I eventually settle on rating one above the other. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Here, in alphabetical order, are the top 10 games that moved me the most in 2023.<br></p>\n\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 cvXwRv\">\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h574383\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><em>Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon</em>\n</h2>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"c9fa00ecbcf0f7a5b6563e406e3fed05\" data-recommend-id=\"image://c9fa00ecbcf0f7a5b6563e406e3fed05\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A mech flies through a sci-fi wasteland. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"c9fa00ecbcf0f7a5b6563e406e3fed05\" data-recommend-id=\"image://c9fa00ecbcf0f7a5b6563e406e3fed05\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A mech flies through a sci-fi wasteland. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I’ve always understood and appreciated the Soulsborne formula and its many flavors on an intellectual level, but <em>Armored Core VI</em> was the game that finally made me feel and love the initial hopelessness and eventual satisfaction that comes from mastering a FromSoftware game. The mech shooter is razor sharp and ultra polished when it comes to zipping around environments and engaging in moment-to-moment combat. You actually feel yourself becoming more in-sync with the custom robot’s strengths and limitations the more you play, each successive boss fight pushing you to come to a deeper understanding of what’s important and what’s just noise. I spent several nights trying to beat Balteus. I don’t regret any of them. And I remain blown away by <em>Armored Core VI</em>’s vibes-based storytelling and branching new game plus mode. Its economical arcade design rewards you for every additional minute you put into it and doesn’t waste time on anything superfluous.</p>\n<aside class=\"sc-1c7snby-0 gGJizi\"></aside>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h574384\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>\n</h2>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"6e1d9738ce737ac1449a7a343c9870c2\" data-recommend-id=\"image://6e1d9738ce737ac1449a7a343c9870c2\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Lae\'zel looks out at the city of Baldur\'s Gate.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"6e1d9738ce737ac1449a7a343c9870c2\" data-recommend-id=\"image://6e1d9738ce737ac1449a7a343c9870c2\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Lae\'zel looks out at the city of Baldur\'s Gate.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Sometimes superfluous is good, though. In fact, sometimes it can be transcendent. The promise of a dozen roads not taken in a video game pays off in making the one you did walk feel unique, unlikely, and unmistakably yours. I love that <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> contains entire games’ worth of conversations, interactions, and outcomes I will never experience. It makes the small journey I have been on feel that much more intimate and personal. None of this would matter, of course, if <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> was not well written, painstakingly choreographed, and expertly voice acted. It’s a dense RPG full of gear and skills to manage alongside quests and boss fights to navigate, and all of it, no matter how it plays out, feels like it was meant to happen that way. It’s the new gold standard for role-playing video games. </p>\n<aside class=\"sc-1c7snby-0 gGJizi\"></aside>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h574385\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><em>Chants of Sennaar</em>\n</h2>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"b556cbad17b8b761f7a88aaf7cea8e90\" data-recommend-id=\"image://b556cbad17b8b761f7a88aaf7cea8e90\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A temple is shown in red and blue. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"b556cbad17b8b761f7a88aaf7cea8e90\" data-recommend-id=\"image://b556cbad17b8b761f7a88aaf7cea8e90\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A temple is shown in red and blue. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I don’t normally like language-based games. (Ironic considering I’m a writer.) I despise crossword puzzles. The inherent fluidity and ambiguousness of language mashed up with the rigid constraints of a game almost always leave me feeling underwhelmed and frustrated. I was shocked, then, to find out just how much I enjoyed <em>Chants of Sennaar</em>, a puzzle adventure about deciphering unknown languages between various factions in a Tower of Babel that oozes highly saturated yellows, blues, and reds. What I appreciated most was how quickly context and intuition helped whittle down possible solutions to problems, making limited communication gratifyingly achievable even when there was no foundation to begin building on. Rather than punish you for the shifty and slippery nature of language, <em>Chants of Sennaar</em> allows those elements to color your overall experience and interpretation of the game without blocking your moment-to-moment progress. </p>\n<aside class=\"sc-1c7snby-0 gGJizi\"></aside>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h574386\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><em>Cocoon</em>\n</h2>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"a78557886c829eb63b5ade6b114d99bf\" data-recommend-id=\"image://a78557886c829eb63b5ade6b114d99bf\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A moth-like creature walks by pods. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"a78557886c829eb63b5ade6b114d99bf\" data-recommend-id=\"image://a78557886c829eb63b5ade6b114d99bf\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A moth-like creature walks by pods. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Cocoon</em> feels like it was chiseled from a rock over thousands of years. Everything unessential has been methodically removed. All that’s left is a seamless sequence of puzzles gently nudging you toward new discoveries and brain-twisting realizations. Remnants of conventional game design like screen icons and boss fight deaths have been elegantly eradicated. Evocative musical queues punctuate each new milestone on your journey. And the rules governing its world are supremely simple but always manage to combine into solutions that feel just outside the realm of possibility. <em>Cocoon </em>is probably one of the best puzzle adventures ever made. </p>\n<aside class=\"sc-1c7snby-0 gGJizi\"></aside>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h574387\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><em>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty</em>\n</h2>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"86ebfa44771bf79130ef66b677139d89\" data-recommend-id=\"image://86ebfa44771bf79130ef66b677139d89\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"V rides a motorcycle through a blockade. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"86ebfa44771bf79130ef66b677139d89\" data-recommend-id=\"image://86ebfa44771bf79130ef66b677139d89\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"V rides a motorcycle through a blockade. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I finished <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>for the first time last year. Despite some fantastic missions and an overwhelmingly intricate open world, it left little impression on me. That seemed a symptom of the underlying structure of the game rather than anything that could be patched out with new abilities or a more impressive sci-fi open world simulation. Night City felt fundamentally alienating to me, and none of the individual characters, story arcs, or RPG progressions managed to pull me out of that feeling of malaise. That is, until <em>Phantom Liberty</em> and the game’s 2.0 update in 2023. The culmination of every new addition, from takedown animations and parrying bullets with katanas to jacked-up car chases and an entire subway system, is an open-world RPG that passes some imaginary threshold from feeling static and paper-thin to one that’s lively and responsive. It helps that <em>Phantom Liberty </em>is a streamlined campaign in a specific part of the map that, dispensing with the MacGuffins of the main plot, can instead weave an interesting and nuanced tale of political intrigue, betrayal, and necessary consequences. Taken together, it’s the game I was hoping <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> could be ever since I finished <em>The Witcher </em>3\'s amazing<em> Hearts of Stone</em> and <em>Blood and Wine</em> expansions. </p>\n<aside class=\"sc-1c7snby-0 gGJizi\"></aside>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h574388\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>Darkest Dungeon II</h2>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"1ba270a00808173fe96e6d56e2624b31\" data-recommend-id=\"image://1ba270a00808173fe96e6d56e2624b31\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Warriors fight abominations as the world burns. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"1ba270a00808173fe96e6d56e2624b31\" data-recommend-id=\"image://1ba270a00808173fe96e6d56e2624b31\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Warriors fight abominations as the world burns. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It only took one caravan ride in Red Hook Studios sequel to convince me it was something special. <em>Darkest Dungeon II</em> takes everything I loved about the first game and puts it in motion, propelling its brutal emergent storytelling and grim probability-based combat over all of the divots and ditches that occasionally ensnared its predecessor. Playing<em> Darkest Dungeon II </em>late at night with the lights turned off made me feel like I was racing through the gothic fall of humankind to save my soul. While it loses some of the managerial depth of the first game, it more than makes up for it with its more cinematic presentation and economical focus. I wish every game could create such an unmistakable sense of place, atmosphere, and engaging stakes with similar efficiency, and made failure feel so rewarding and profound.</p>\n<aside class=\"sc-1c7snby-0 gGJizi\"></aside>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h574389\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>\n</h2>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"7375f3ee1bbad2cba36a8c531703fdd0\" data-recommend-id=\"image://7375f3ee1bbad2cba36a8c531703fdd0\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Clive looks out at ruins in the desert. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"7375f3ee1bbad2cba36a8c531703fdd0\" data-recommend-id=\"image://7375f3ee1bbad2cba36a8c531703fdd0\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Clive looks out at ruins in the desert. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This is the problematic fave on this list. <em>Final Fantasy XVI </em>disappointed me in so many ways. From its shallow RPG systems to its dreary and cumbersome second half, the latest game in the Square Enix series felt like it left so much untapped potential on the table. It makes me dream of what the team might accomplish if given the time and resources to mount <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>’s three-year turn around from Early Access to 2.0 victory lap. Instead of droning on about all the things I disliked about this game, I’ll simply say that it’s highs were higher than almost anything else I played this year and kept me coming back through a new game plus run which has reminded me why I love it, from the incredibly sleek and satisfying action to the magnificent cinematic boss fights. When the writing isn’t falling down flat on its face and the sky isn’t overcast with an impenetrable gloom, there is more than one flicker of the return to form <em>Final Fantasy</em> fans like me have been waiting more than a decade for.</p>\n<aside class=\"sc-1c7snby-0 gGJizi\"></aside>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h574390\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><em>Super Mario Bros.

It feels like a cheating. Every stage in <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> is juiced to the max, carefully engineered to delight, entertain, and continually surprise you, all while maintaining the series’ tightly calibrated platforming feel and bespoke attention to detail. <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> doesn’t catapult the formula forward or feel as inventive as recent  puzzle boxes like<em> Super Mario 3D World </em>and <em>Bowser’s Fury</em>.

You play religious outcasts scavenging solar systems for resources to survive until the next cryo-sleep-induced hyper-light jump. The greatest terrors I felt in any game this year came from the prospect of miscalculating fuel reserves and how long I have until the next supernova. <em>The Banished Vault </em>can feel straightforward once you unravel its economy, but that process of demystification is complex and enthralling, and richly infused with meaning thanks to the austere presentation and haunting soundtrack. It made contemplating certain doom not just thrilling but spiritually soothing. </p>\n<aside class=\"sc-1c7snby-0 gGJizi\"></aside>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h574392\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>\n</h2>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"a883922ed165c540b7f2fc0fdc175c7c\" data-recommend-id=\"image://a883922ed165c540b7f2fc0fdc175c7c\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"900\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A fairy gives her blessing. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"a883922ed165c540b7f2fc0fdc175c7c\" data-recommend-id=\"image://a883922ed165c540b7f2fc0fdc175c7c\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"900\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A fairy gives her blessing. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> was a slam dunk. It surpassed my wildest expectations, taking what impressed me about <em>Breath of the Wild </em>and finding even more ways to surprise, delight, and gently lead me through its whimsical, dangerous, beautiful world. Game critics love to reward novelty, ambition, and bold experimentation. The nature of playing so many things and being exposed to so much naturally places a premium on the new and unexpected. <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> has plenty of that, but more than anything it shows masters of their craft assessing, refining, and iterating on a formula they’ve spent decades on, like Chevy working on a new Corvette or Porsche making the latest 911. I’m still stunned that there’s a <em>Zelda</em> game where you can make your own rocket ship and somehow it doesn’t feel like a gimmick but rather like the most obvious and natural thing you could do in an open world fantasy adventure. </p>\n<aside class=\"sc-1c7snby-0 gGJizi\"></aside>\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 cvXwRv\">\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>Honorable mentions:</strong> <em>Season: A Letter to the Future</em>,<em> Humanity</em>, <em>Jusant</em>, <em>Planet of Lana</em>, <em>Saltsea Chronicle</em>s, <em>Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew</em>.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>Needed more time with:</strong> <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, <em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em>, <em>Remnant II</em>, <em>Lies of P, Laika: Aged Through Blood</em>,<em> Dredge</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>Didn’t get to:</strong> <em>Terra Nil</em>, <em>Against the Storm</em>, <em>Fading Afternoon</em>, <em>A Space for the Unbound, Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, The Talos Principle 2</em>, <em>Slay the Princess</em>, <em>Void Stranger</em>, and many more.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>Liked but didn’t love:</strong> <em>Spider-Man 2</em>, <em>Starfield</em>, <em>Diablo IV</em>, <em>Sea of Stars</em>, <em>Hi-Fi Rush, Moonring</em>, <em>Thirsty Suitors</em>.</p>', '2024-03-11 11:35:02', '2024-03-11 11:35:02', 'Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom And Everything Else That Blew Me Away: Ethan Gach’s Top 10 Games Of 2023', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/976971883bb97ff809aeb340846279b0.jpg', 'year-in-review', 'https://kotaku.com/best-games-2023-zelda-cyberpunk-baldur-s-gate-3-a-1851130971', 'I love the idea of annual top 10 lists until it comes time to actually make one....', '');

Without a new mainline role-playing game to dominate the series’ headlines, Pikachu and friends were, instead, shrouded in controversies throughout the past 12 months.

While this affects every game and service on those platforms, <em>Pokémon </em>is in a precarious position because the loss of the 3DS eShop has created a gap between <em>Pokémon </em>generations. Trading old Pokémon to new games has been a long-held tradition within the series. It’s taken different forms between games, but the practice has become much more streamlined with the introduction of platform-agnostic services like <em>Pokémon Home</em> that host Pokémon from any game that can connect to the internet. However, the 3DS has been the bridge between older generations and <em>Home </em>through an app called <em>Pokémon Bank</em>. This 3DS app is used to transfer Pokémon from 3DS games to <em>Home</em>, thus to Switch games like <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Pokémon Home </em>is still probably the best solution The Pokémon Company has launched for this problem, as it doesn’t have to rely on specific hardware to store and trade different monsters. But without <em>Bank</em>, some Pokémon have become difficult or even impossible to obtain and trade over to modern games. As of this writing, <em>Bank </em>still works for those who had it purchased and installed on their 3DS before the eShop shutdown, but the tool is no longer readily available for new players.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"65446be2efb3efee37d99da0682cdb32\" data-recommend-id=\"image://65446be2efb3efee37d99da0682cdb32\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1409\" data-height=\"793\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The cast of The Indigo Disk is shown in front of Blueberry Academy.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"65446be2efb3efee37d99da0682cdb32\" data-recommend-id=\"image://65446be2efb3efee37d99da0682cdb32\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1409\" data-height=\"793\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The cast of The Indigo Disk is shown in front of Blueberry Academy.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h547755\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Competitive <em>Pokémon </em>has a big hacking controversy</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">While not every <em>Pokémon </em>player is embedded in the competitive scene, ranked <em>Pokémon </em>play is still a pillar of the RPGs millions of people play every year.

However, some competitors told <em>Kotaku</em> The Pokémon Company’s rulings on this matter have been inconsistent, which made their bans at the headlining event of the year all the more devastating.

Going this route doesn’t necessarily give you a competitive edge but can be viewed as not within the spirit of the franchise. Competitive players argue that using a tool like this is just a matter of saving time, allowing users to craft a team without having to do so within the boundaries of games like <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>.

But if they sell 23 million copies despite being raked through the coals for their poor technical performance, is anything actually going to change? If The Pokémon Company knows it can count on people to show up, no matter how poor or frustrating its offerings are, can the machine ever be stopped?</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Last year, <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus </em>and <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>showed that <em>Pokémon </em>is <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-arceus-scarlet-violet-ash-pikachu-anime-1849920098\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-arceus-scarlet-violet-ash-pikachu-anime-1849920098\">growing beyond simply banking on nostalgia</a></span>.

The machine is pumping out <em>Pokémon </em>games, cards, merchandise, and collaborations at a rate only rivaled by the late ‘90s Pokémania era.

Because of that, there’s a lot of sex, swearing, incest, and even the occasional child murder. (At least one of those dead kids totally had it coming, for what it’s worth.) For the most part, this grown-up glow-up works better than you’d expect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Yet for all its <em>Game of Thrones</em> trappings and potty-mouth interludes, the plot of <em>FF16</em> reminds me most of <em>Final Fantasy IV</em>.

Many fans who jumped on the bandwagon with <em>Three Houses</em> (myself included) were expecting the next installment of the series to serve up more of the same.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">That’s not what you’re going to get from 2023’s <em>Fire Emblem Engage</em>. The story is a serviceable jumble of RPG clichés that will have you rolling your eyes on more than one occasion. Compared to <em>Three Houses’</em> individual riffs on school uniforms, the character designs feel overworked and busy. In so many ways, it’s a step back. But despite that, I played <em>Engage</em> for more than 70 hours last year. That’s because the combat is relentlessly fun and tactically satisfying, and there’s precious little story to wade through in order to get to it. While I have a bigger soft spot in my heart for <em>Three Houses</em>, I’m far more likely to revisit its faster, dumber sibling when I need a quick strategy hit. – Jen Glennon</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>Buy <em>Fire Emblem Engage:</em></strong><em> </em><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\"[]\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fire-EmblemTM-Engage-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0BF1W7K23?asc_campaign=kinjalink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/best-rpgs-2023-jrpg-baldur-s-gate-3-octopath-traveler-2-1851128706&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjalink-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\" data-amazonasin=\"B0BF1W7K23\" data-amazontag=\"kinjalink-20\">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://howl.me/cliZbcwMLYu\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://howl.me/cliZbcwMLYu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\">Best Buy</a></span> </p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h550694\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><em><strong>Like a Dragon: Ishin!</strong></em>\n</h2>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"7b7edb2ae73ca5d716320960f1c942c3\" data-recommend-id=\"image://7b7edb2ae73ca5d716320960f1c942c3\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A samurai shoots a man at a train station. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"7b7edb2ae73ca5d716320960f1c942c3\" data-recommend-id=\"image://7b7edb2ae73ca5d716320960f1c942c3\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A samurai shoots a man at a train station. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">There’s a lot of <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/like-dragon-gaiden-review-yakuza-man-erased-name-1850993808\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/like-dragon-gaiden-review-yakuza-man-erased-name-1850993808\"><em>Yakuza</em></a></span><em> </em>games out there.

With a timeline more intricate than the MCU and more characters than a Dostoyevsky novel, it’s daunting trying to figure out where to dive into the series that spawned countless memes. <em>Like a Dragon: Ishin!</em> is a standalone spin-off set during the waning days of Japan’s samurai era, during the mid-19th century.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Despite the veneer of educational value and historical import, <em>Ishin</em> retains the <em>Yakuza</em> series’ beloved goofball humor and affinity for bizarre minigames. You’ll have to prevent innocent rubes from joining a dance-crazed cult, chop cannonballs in half with a katana, and gamble on high-stakes chicken racing. <em>Yakuza</em>’s trademark batshit, button-mashing combat will be familiar to series vets but is intuitive enough for newcomers to pick up on the fly.

While it may not have exploded the way <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em> or <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> did, the <em>Canterbury Tales</em>-esque story has characters just as deep and writing just as sharp, and although its turn-based battles may seem simple on the surface, their complexity deepens over its many hours just as its cast of eight adventurers does. Perhaps it’s a result of bigger names and budgets overshadowing it, but <em>Octopath Traveler II</em> should have been in a lot of year-end conversations, and it stands tall alongside its flashier contemporaries. — Kenneth Shepard</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>Buy <em>Octopath Traveler II</em></strong><em>: </em><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\"[]\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Octopath-Traveler-II-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0BF66G8F9?asc_campaign=kinjalink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/best-rpgs-2023-jrpg-baldur-s-gate-3-octopath-traveler-2-1851128706&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjalink-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\" data-amazonasin=\"B0BF66G8F9\" data-amazontag=\"kinjalink-20\">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://howl.me/cliZjuswYzU\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://howl.me/cliZjuswYzU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\">Best Buy</a></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h550699\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><em><strong>Asgard’s Wrath 2</strong></em>\n</h2>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"a92e700afbe8b4b9a85cd292ab42b609\" data-recommend-id=\"image://a92e700afbe8b4b9a85cd292ab42b609\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1900\" data-height=\"1068\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A first-person view shows someone riding toward a temple. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"a92e700afbe8b4b9a85cd292ab42b609\" data-recommend-id=\"image://a92e700afbe8b4b9a85cd292ab42b609\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1900\" data-height=\"1068\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A first-person view shows someone riding toward a temple. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Virtual Reality has a triple-A game gap: No one’s making meaty, sprawling adventures with the length and scope of high-budget console games…or even of a typical console RPG. For a certain type of player, VR’s relative lack of this type of “triple-A” experience is a big turn-off.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Asgard’s Wrath 2</em>, the new, wide-open RPG from Meta-acquired Sanzaru Games, seeks to prove that VR and triple-A need not be mutually exclusive, throwing you into a decidedly massive world filled with allies to befriend, dungeons to plunder, and gods to dethrone. The scope is there and the game is fun, easy to lose yourself in for hours. If you were only going to play a single new VR game this year, <em>Wrath 2</em> would be a strong choice.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s enjoyed a largely positive critical reception, echoing that of its 2019 PC-only predecessor. While <em>Wrath 2</em>’s budget is unknown, it got a relatively large ad campaign, is the first Quest VR game to retail for $60, and is included free with every Quest 3 headset. Meta’s clearly chasing a certain sort of mainstream appeal here, and in this case, seems to be succeeding. — Alexandra Hall</p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h550700\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><em><strong>Sea of Stars</strong></em>\n</h2>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"bba0bc017fd110ee441756facbd88432\" data-recommend-id=\"image://bba0bc017fd110ee441756facbd88432\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Pixel characters walk around an overworld map. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"bba0bc017fd110ee441756facbd88432\" data-recommend-id=\"image://bba0bc017fd110ee441756facbd88432\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Pixel characters walk around an overworld map. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If it <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://gonintendo.com/contents/30317-chrono-trigger-devs-talk-sequel-chances-praise-sea-of-stars\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://gonintendo.com/contents/30317-chrono-trigger-devs-talk-sequel-chances-praise-sea-of-stars\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">looks like <em>Chrono Trigger</em></a></span><em> </em>and <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/sea-of-stars-game-impressions-review-switch-jrpg-indie-1850854165\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/sea-of-stars-game-impressions-review-switch-jrpg-indie-1850854165\">plays like<em> Chrono Trigger</em></a></span>, it just might be <em>Sea of Stars</em>. The homage to 16-bit SNES RPGs by Sabotage Studio combines lush environments and beautiful pixel sprites with <em>Mario </em>&amp; <em>Luigi</em>-style turn-based battles. Timed button presses can make regular attacks more powerful or shave off damage from incoming enemy ones, and instead of a standard revive system, characters automatically come back to life at regular intervals in battle, adding an extra layer of strategy to otherwise straightforward fights. <em>Sea of Stars</em> is a flashy game with clever dungeon designs and great music.

The real-time combat is cleaner and more polished than that in any other Bethesda RPG, and sports a range of space powers that help make you feel like more than just another gun-toting sci-fi jarhead. Its greatest trick is an inventive new game plus mode which I won’t spoil here but is well worth racing through the main campaign to experience for yourself.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But perhaps where <em>Starfield</em> excels the most is in giving players the complete freedom to roam around the galaxy collecting scrap, building tiny space colonies, and leaving your small mark on a universe too sprawling to notice. Composer Inon Zur’s soundtrack imbues some of the game’s most chill and lonely scenes with a beautiful sense of empty vastness. Where many open-world games are championed for the breadth and density of their to-do lists, <em>Starfield </em>isn’t afraid to ignore you and let you toil away on your own projects uninterrupted by overly-chatty characters or climactic plot arcs. — Ethan Gach</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>Buy <em>Starfield</em></strong><em>: </em><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\"[]\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Starfield-Standard-Xbox-X/dp/B0C7PN2L5V?asc_campaign=kinjalink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/best-rpgs-2023-jrpg-baldur-s-gate-3-octopath-traveler-2-1851128706&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjalink-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\" data-amazonasin=\"B0C7PN2L5V\" data-amazontag=\"kinjalink-20\">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://howl.me/cliZl1ERZwG\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://howl.me/cliZl1ERZwG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\">Best Buy</a></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h550702\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><em><strong>Diablo IV</strong></em>\n</h2>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"78386caada6597be05d322050845958f\" data-recommend-id=\"image://78386caada6597be05d322050845958f\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Characters oversee a blood ritual. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"78386caada6597be05d322050845958f\" data-recommend-id=\"image://78386caada6597be05d322050845958f\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Characters oversee a blood ritual. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Like any live-service grindfest, <em>Diablo IV</em> feels hopelessly flawed.

That is no longer the case as the game continues to get some healthy updates that make it deserving of gathering your friends together for <em>Halo</em> nights once more.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This year didn’t just give <em>Halo </em>more maps and modes, however.

Ahead of the likely reveal of the Nintendo handheld hybrid’s successor next year, the aging hardware continued receiving an amazing slate of new games in 2023, including<em> </em><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-the-kotaku-r-1850570840\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-the-kotaku-r-1850570840\"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a></span>, one of the best entries to date in the long-running fantasy adventure series. Last year, the Switch felt like it was quietly fading away. 2023 proved that the barebones console still had a few more tricks up its sleeve, showing once again why it’s one of the most beloved gaming machines ever made.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The story of the Switch these last six years has been a simple one: make amazing games and players will show up. Affordable hardware that prioritized convenience over specs proved you don’t need teraflops and great online play to sell a console, just an open-world <em>Zelda</em> or two and a reliable drip-feed of other stellar first-party exclusives. What’s remarkable about the Switch is not how much it’s grown since 2017 but how little it’s changed. In 2023 it almost feels like we’ve come full circle again, with Nintendo neglecting every expectation of a modern gaming platform while it instead tinkers away on new hits.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">That’s not to say that the famed Japanese game company has retreated into itself. It’s done anything but that, branching out into movies, theme parks, and new toy crossovers. But 2023’s stacked release calendar did buy Nintendo some extra time and goodwill while it brushes off myriad questions about a Switch 2, backwards compatibility, and what the hell ever happened to <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-samus-aran-nintendo-retro-studios-twitt-1848559323\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-samus-aran-nintendo-retro-studios-twitt-1848559323\"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a></span>. An old tablet running on a 2015 graphics chip still had some gas left in the tank after all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The console itself is the same as it ever was. Instead of new peripherals, accessories, or updated hardware, Nintendo released special edition <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>and <em>Mario </em>OLED Switches. The software was similarly untouched. Despite six firmware updates, the Switch received no meaningful new software features in 2023. Something as simple as custom backgrounds are still MIA and party chat remains exclusive to the mobile app for many games. The third-party social hub Discord was fully integrated into PlayStation and Xbox this year. Not on Switch, however. Like Netflix, it doesn’t seem like the app is destined to come to Nintendo’s console. What did come to the handheld hybrid were great games.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h5529\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><em>Zelda</em> and <em>Mario</em> save the day, again</h2>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"9d31ac0662332a6622590c338dbe43eb\" data-recommend-id=\"image://9d31ac0662332a6622590c338dbe43eb\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Mario and friends can\'t believe Bowser is back. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"9d31ac0662332a6622590c338dbe43eb\" data-recommend-id=\"image://9d31ac0662332a6622590c338dbe43eb\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Mario and friends can\'t believe Bowser is back. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The Switch launched in 2017 with <em>Breath of the Wild </em>and, later that year, <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. The star-studded lineup felt like a <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/2023-best-year-games-goty-switch-ps5-xbox-1850968555\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/2023-best-year-games-goty-switch-ps5-xbox-1850968555\">once-in-a-generation moment of serendipity</a></span>, but Nintendo managed to replicate that magic to bookend the console’s lifecycle. <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> wasn’t just a remix of the open-world <em>Zelda </em>formula, it was a fundamental reworking of it that made building a rocket ship feel as natural as firing an arrow at a Keese. <em>Breath of the Wild</em> let players loose in big, beautiful landscapes full of monsters and puzzles. <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> took them underground and to the skies as well, adding new verticality to a sprawling open world and taking crafting out of a menu screen into the natural environment.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Nintendo finished 2023 with <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em>, a maximalist return to the platformer’s 2D roots bursting with new mechanics, visual flourishes, and memorable side-scrolling setpieces. It featured the influence of dense <em>Super Mario Maker</em>-style level designs and hazardous obstacle courses alongside callbacks to <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> and <em>Super Mario World</em>, culminating in a conservative crowd pleaser that nevertheless ended up being the fastest-selling game in the franchise’s history.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">These tentpoles make it easy to forget how strong the rest of the Switch’s release calendar was this year. Things kicked off with <em>Fire Emblem Engag</em>e and <em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em>. <em>Pikmin 4</em> made a big splash in the summer.<em> Detective Pikachu Returns</em> and <em>Super Mario RPG</em> helped round out the end of the year. <em>Mario Kart 8</em> <em>Deluxe</em> continued adding new characters and tracks, while <em>Pokemon Scarlet/Violet </em>and <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 3 </em>both received sizable expansions. Switch also scored big with a timed exclusive console port of Steam sensation <em>Dave the Diver</em>, and versions of many of the year’s biggest indie games from <em>Dredge </em>and <em>Space for the Unbound</em> to <em>Sea of Stars </em>and <em>Blasphemous 2</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The only department in which Switch remains incredibly deficient is ports of major third-party blockbusters. Fans are used to not getting the latest big-budget releases like <em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor </em>or <em>Diablo IV</em>, but even the games that do make the jump are noticeably nerfed. Planned Switch versions of <em>Evil Dead: The Game</em>, <em>RoboCop: Rogue City</em>, and <em>Marvel’s Midnight Suns </em>were all canceled. Meanwhile <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> did eventually arrive after a long delay, but with severely stripped-down visuals. A surprise <em>Batman Arkham Trilogy</em> release was also a dud, with painful tradeoffs that made the collection almost impossible to recommend on the underpowered hardware. Clearly the wizards at Nintendo know something about optimizing games for the Switch that others don’t. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h5530\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>Switch Online levels up</h2>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"e9745c1baaa7e511614359d29add29a7\" data-recommend-id=\"image://e9745c1baaa7e511614359d29add29a7\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games are displayed on a red background. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"e9745c1baaa7e511614359d29add29a7\" data-recommend-id=\"image://e9745c1baaa7e511614359d29add29a7\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games are displayed on a red background. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Nintendo’s multiplayer and retro library subscription service added Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance games in 2023, answering the prayers of fans desperate to be able to officially access classics like<em> The Legend of Zelda: Minish Cap </em>and <em>Metroid Fusion</em> again. The new games were added to the Expansion Pack tier, which still costs $50 a year even as other services have been raising prices. The subscription also gave Switch owners access to <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>’s new DLC and the new battle royale spin-off <em>F-Zero 99</em>.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Given that Switch Online is still the only subscription service that doesn’t include access to new and recent third-party games, it’s hard to say if it’s any more “worth it” in 2023 than it was when it first launched. The selection of games has more than doubled, with the N64 library adding <em>GoldenEye 007 </em>and <em>Pokémon Stadium</em> this year, and even the NES getting surprise drops like <em>Mystery Tower</em> and <em>Devil World</em>, a Miyamoto-designed maze game never previously localized in North America.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">At the same time, it’s become clear that the Switch Online retro library is a double-edged sword. Users can’t buy the games outright, forcing them to subscribe for the whole bundle rather than just purchase the few they actually want to play. They also have to stay subscribed if they don’t want to lose access to them. Stop paying for even a month and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Majora</em>’s <em>Mask </em>gets locked down again. And games ripe for remakes or remasters will likely never get added to the service to begin with, like <em>Super Mario RPG</em>. <em>Final Fantasy IV </em>and <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> are obvious candidates to increase the value of Switch Online’s SNES library, but because they’re available separately through the Pixel Remaster collection, the retro library that subscribers are paying for remains woefully incomplete. Of course, all this could be forgiven if Nintendo finally added <em>Mother 3</em>. </p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h5531\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>Nintendo’s crackdown on leakers and fans</h2>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"8b1e614921c5abaae6206bf375967c8c\" data-recommend-id=\"image://8b1e614921c5abaae6206bf375967c8c\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1200\" data-height=\"675\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Link holds up a DMCA strike. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"8b1e614921c5abaae6206bf375967c8c\" data-recommend-id=\"image://8b1e614921c5abaae6206bf375967c8c\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1200\" data-height=\"675\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Link holds up a DMCA strike. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s now routine for big first-party Switch games to leak before their official release date, get uploaded online, and spread like wildfire across internet backchannels. Fans began mining games like <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>and <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder </em>for secrets and spoilers over a week before they were actually available. While Nintendo has maintained a hard line against piracy and leaks alike, subpoenaing entire Discord servers for user data to further its legal case against alleged infringements, the end of the Switch’s life may be hastened by a <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://twitter.com/AfterTimeX/status/1738266579110961660\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://twitter.com/AfterTimeX/status/1738266579110961660\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">new round of flashcarts</a></span> that could facilitate piracy.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Even more notably, Nintendo <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/nintendo-gamecube-wii-emulator-dolphin-valve-piracy-1850482929\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/nintendo-gamecube-wii-emulator-dolphin-valve-piracy-1850482929\">appeared to intervene</a></span> to get the Dolphin GameCube and Wii emulator locked out of Valve’s Steam marketplace. A store listing for the longstanding project appeared in March. By May, however, Valve had removed the listing while the two sides worked through the legal issues. “Nintendo respects the intellectual property rights of other companies, and in turn expects others to do the same,” a spokesperson for the company told <em>Kotaku</em> at the time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">More surprising has been Nintendo’s apparent war on its own super fans, from YouTubers showcasing its games to esports pros competing in <em>Smash Bros.

New rules appeared to outlaw grassroots tournaments and ban modified games like<em> Project M</em>, the popular fan variant of <em>Smash Bros. Melee</em>.

Whether it’s a Switch 2, Switch Pro, or entirely new piece of hardware altogether, it’s hard to imagine Nintendo not showing its new console by the start of its next fiscal year in April 2024. There have been reports of developer demos behind closed doors at Gamescom, and of hardware specs that might put the successor inline with the PS4 era of consoles. President Shuntaro Furukawa <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-rumors-activision-1850998489\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-rumors-activision-1850998489\">denied Nintendo was showing off a new device</a></span> to partners ahead of the holiday, but the evidence continues to mount for something coming next year. If it doesn’t, 2024 could be the slowest year for the Switch since it launched.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But if it does, there’s reason to hope a Switch 2 might offer a more graceful transition than the Wii U did. “Our goal is to minimize the dip you typically see in the last year of one cycle and the beginning of another,” Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser said earlier this year. “I can’t speak to the possible features of a new platform, but the Nintendo Account is a strong basis for having that communication as we make the transition.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s hard to imagine buying a new Nintendo console and starting out from scratch at this point. Then again, it’s Nintendo we’re talking about. Who knows if the Switch 2 will support 4K, have an OLED screen, or even a slot for Switch 1 cartridges. <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-rumors-leaks-predictions-features-1851038534\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-rumors-leaks-predictions-features-1851038534\">It might not even launch with built-in voice chat</a></span>, let alone streaming apps.

Valve has continued to improve the software experience to deliver direct and reliable performance on modern titles with an open door to decades worth of gaming via the virtually endless Steam Library. </p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h151370\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>With thousands of playable titles, Steam Deck thrived in 2023</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.protondb.com/\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.protondb.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">According to ProtonDB</a></span>, the Steam Deck now boasts over 13,000 playable and verified games. Verified status typically ensures that a game will run as pain-free as possible: Download the game, boot it up, have fun. Meanwhile, Playable status indicates that a game may have some discomforts (such as a stubborn launcher window, text that’s slightly too small, or a lack of dedicated gamepad button support). </p>\n\n<section class=\"sc-q35npn-0 eNnFZk\">\n</section>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">While “Verified” status typically means you’ll have a great time with a game on the Deck, the community has made it even easier to get down to the nitty gritty details of what kind of performance you can expect from any given title by way of ProtonDB, a database of user experiences running games on Steam Deck and other Linux-based hardware. Here, you can read up on what kinds of experiences folks have had with any given title, and even pick up a few tips on the best settings to tweak. It’s a great way to improve the experience of not just Verified and Playable titles, but even of games that are technically unsupported. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Take Bethesda’s <em>Starfield</em>, for example. While listed as unsupported on the game’s storefront, many Steam Deck users have shared their experiences of what it takes to get the galactic-scale RPG running at least reasonably well. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You’ll have to set your expectations appropriately, accepting more than a few graphical sacrifices, but <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.protondb.com/app/1716740\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.protondb.com/app/1716740\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Starfield</em>’s ProtonDB page</a></span> indicates that many people are able to get a workable experience romping around star systems.

He makes a strong impression, bemoaning the fact that he now has to babysit a “freelancer.” Your first time through the game, Iguazu simply seems like a bottom-of-the-barrel grunt, the whiny character who’s inevitably one of the first to bite the bullet.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">While that’s true on your first playthrough, things with Iguazu get really interesting on your second and third times through the game.

This then led to him being recruited by the Redguns, and coming face to face with 621. At first he’s simply annoyed by you, but as he grows more aware of your piloting skills, the hate starts creeping in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">As you betray and dismantle the Redguns, Iguazu voices his open resentment of your skills and your freedom. You, the player, are everything Iguazu can never be. You’re a master of your own destiny, while Iguazu finds himself stuck in a war he cares little about, unable to free himself from its shackles. Every single interaction you have with Iguazu, you can see his resentment growing, bit by bit. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">After the Redguns are officially dismantled, he takes a freelance contract and launches a surprise ambush on you. Ironically, he’s completely unaware of the AI named All-Mind, which has been pulling the strings all along. His revenge plot foiled, in absolute desperation he takes a “deal with the devil,” letting All-Mind augment him into the perfect killing machine. He believes his freedom with the singular goal of spiteing you the player, your death the only thing on his mind.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"9ffa47814fd350fc15a6b2cf659742bd\" data-recommend-id=\"image://9ffa47814fd350fc15a6b2cf659742bd\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The intimidating final boss of Armored Core 6.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"9ffa47814fd350fc15a6b2cf659742bd\" data-recommend-id=\"image://9ffa47814fd350fc15a6b2cf659742bd\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The intimidating final boss of Armored Core 6.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h5222\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>Inhuman nature</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">All this culminates in the defining moment that cements Iguazu as a villain for the ages. The end of your third playthrough of <em>AC6</em> reveals all the machinations of All-Mind, and as you approach the final battle you see Iguazu has been warped beyond recognition, now piloting an experimental suit built from all of the simulation battles you completed. This means that Iguazu’s new form is quite literally built from all the people you killed and backstabbed to get to this point. He’s quite literally the avatar of everything and everyone that’s been thrown against you on Rubicon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">That collective will might seem like the final boss, but in another staggering twist, halfway through the battle Iguazu realizes that your partner, Ayre, has been affecting his mind this entire time. Through sheer force of will, he shuts All-Mind out and banishes Ayre from the fight. Iguauzu realizes he’s lost his freedom, but in a final act he levels the playing field, finally paving the way for the one-on-one duel he’s craved all along.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Time and again, the player overcomes seemingly insurmountable odds, eschewing the plans of corporations and powerful people in the name of true freedom. Iguazu is the other side of that coin. He is a man without free will who found purpose through a singular obsession of destroying you. You took different paths but arrived at the same place, the same answer. For a game that tells its story in such a minimalist manner, it’s unexpectedly introspective and philosophical.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s not often you see a villain truly represent the worst parts of us—not just desire for power but pettiness, spite, jealousy, and hate. Iguazu is the perfect reflection of the player themselves, and someone that suffers for all of our actions. Even despite all that, he finds a moment of respect in the final battle, a solidarity for the unwanted life that has been forced on the both of you.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If you lose to Iguazu in the final battle, his last line sums things up perfectly: “Leave a spot for me in Hell.”</p>\n\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 cvXwRv\">\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Armored Core VI</em> is out now for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</p>\n<aside class=\"sc-1c7snby-0 gGJizi\"></aside>', '2024-03-11 11:35:02', '2024-03-11 11:35:02', '2023\'s Best Video Game Villain Isn\'t Who You Think', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/7f5408a44a1d9eafe2ac4b8d8b01c4c8.jpg', 'year-in-review', 'https://kotaku.com/best-video-game-villain-2023-armored-core-6-acvi-iguazu-1851108825', 'Mech pilots have feelings, too.

But despite the obvious problems within our industry that 2023 unmasked, it was a massive year when it came to the sheer quantity and quality of games on offer.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">When it came time to start deliberating on <em>Kotaku</em>’s Game of the Year (GOTY) list, I was understandably nervous. There were so many damn games that the initial list was daunting, and the math involved to narrow everything down was a harsh reminder that I am, indeed, very bad with numbers. I double- and triple-checked it all, I sent kind-but-firm reminders to <em>Kotaku</em> staff to get their votes in, and after a few weeks, the list was born. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/2023-best-year-games-goty-switch-ps5-xbox-1850968555\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/2023-best-year-games-goty-switch-ps5-xbox-1850968555\">2023 Is The Best Year For Games In A While</a></span></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Is this year’s list surprising?

Hell, even <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> finally lived up to expectations with its <em>Phantom Liberty</em> expansion and massive patch.

It’s even weirder for me as I was firmly against the idea of remaking <em>Resident Evil 4</em>. But the <em>Resident Evil 4 </em>remake is special. It’s a game worth playing, even if you have never touched a previous <em>Resident Evil </em>title, including the original <em>RE4 </em>(and all its various ports). It balances tense and challenging combat with slower moments that ratchet up the tension and let you explore its gorgeously detailed and spooky world.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Yes, some surprises aren’t that surprising if you’ve played the original game. But Capcom went the extra mile and tweaked areas, encounters, and other moments <em>just </em>enough that as a veteran player, I found myself frequently unsure of what was going to happen next. Most of these changes to gameplay, like making the knife more useful, feel thoughtful and deliberate, not just the result of developers trying to make something old feel new in 2023.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Before this remake, people would often ask if there was a point to remaking <em>RE4</em>, as it is such a fantastic game already, even 18 years after its release. It didn’t seem like a worthwhile endeavor, especially when there are other entries in the franchise that deserve some love. But after playing the remake, it’s clear that Capcom didn’t simply want to “up res” the old game and resell it (again). Instead, the studio put in the work and time and crafted a standalone horror masterpiece that will go on to be as beloved and well-regarded as the original, even surpassing it in many ways. So I guess I’m glad I was wrong about it.<br><br><strong>Zack Zwiezen, staff writer</strong><br></p>\n<aside class=\"sc-1c7snby-0 gGJizi\"></aside>\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 cvXwRv\">\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h4861\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>11. <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em>\n</h2>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"182c399d7f4af9ff59b34a3137c27284\" data-recommend-id=\"image://182c399d7f4af9ff59b34a3137c27284\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Miles Morales and Peter Parker look into the camera while wearing their Spider-Man suits.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"182c399d7f4af9ff59b34a3137c27284\" data-recommend-id=\"image://182c399d7f4af9ff59b34a3137c27284\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Miles Morales and Peter Parker look into the camera while wearing their Spider-Man suits.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Spider-Man 2</em> asks the question: what if the original <em>Spider-Man</em>, but bigger, bolder, and better? Insomniac smartly takes the winning formula from the 2018 action-adventure game and adds a few dashes of extra essence, offering an even-more-detailed Manhattan (plus new ways to traverse it), the ability to swap between Peter Parker and Miles Morales with ease, and some new bad guys you’ll have to contend with. From beginning to end, <em>Spider-Man 2</em> offers an uninterrupted drip of gamer serotonin.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Sure, it’s not the kind of game that will be lauded for its ingenuity, nor is it the kind that would have won Game of the Year at this year’s Game Awards when facing titans like <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> and <em>Alan Wake II</em>, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a fantastic experience. <em>Spider-Man 2</em> is a beautifully polished, well-oiled machine, like a 2024 luxury car that looks, mostly, like the one that came the year before it. Just like that luxury vehicle, it’ll impress you with its shiny exterior and impressive handling, and constantly remind you that it is, in fact, a luxury experience. It’s the kind of game you can effortlessly jump into and mess around in for a few solid hours without breaking a mental or physical sweat, a joyously exuberant and bright game that other superhero titles could only ever hope to be. <br><br><strong>Alyssa Mercante, senior editor</strong></p>\n<aside class=\"sc-1c7snby-0 gGJizi\"></aside>\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 cvXwRv\">\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h4862\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>10. <em>Dave the Diver</em>\n</h2>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"606fa9929bf7f84191cf4aba352b208e\" data-recommend-id=\"image://606fa9929bf7f84191cf4aba352b208e\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"All the characters from Dave the Diver gather under a massive merman statue. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"606fa9929bf7f84191cf4aba352b208e\" data-recommend-id=\"image://606fa9929bf7f84191cf4aba352b208e\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"All the characters from Dave the Diver gather under a massive merman statue. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/tgas-dave-the-diver-indie-game-geoff-keighley-debate-1851049334\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/tgas-dave-the-diver-indie-game-geoff-keighley-debate-1851049334\">Indie or not</a></span><strong>, </strong><em>Dave the Diver</em> deserves your attention as one of the year’s best games.

The game could have been too hard, too focused on copying the Soulslike-formula, or too obsessed with the most obscure <em>Star Wars</em> lore, leaving non-fans confused. However, Respawn was able to pull it off, delivering an action-packed <em>Star Wars</em> adventure that had enough heart and dramatic moments to stand toe-to-toe with any of the recent films, and even win over some folks who were done with the franchise.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">These days, in an era when it feels like games are getting longer and bigger every year, it’s rare that I end a game and feel sad that there isn’t more. Often, I’m happy to reach the credits and move on after slogging through 100 hours of whatever I was doing. But that wasn’t the case with <em>Survivor</em>. I wanted another planet to explore.

But to me, that stuff isn’t as important as the actual main game, which I played all the way through twice this year.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Diablo IV </em>doesn’t change up the franchise’s formula all that much as developer Blizzard knows that <em>Diablo</em>’s gameplay is hard to improve on. However, after fans complained about <em>Diablo 3</em>’s narrative and tone, Blizzard saw an opportunity to craft a sequel that felt more like the gothic and dark original games, and the results are obvious in <em>IV</em>. There are some genuinely great quests throughout this game, and some cutscenes that will stick in my memory for years to come.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">And yes, in 2023, it is still fun to run through a giant pack of monsters, pop a few big spells and abilities, and watch them all evaporate in a glorious explosion of particles. It’s even better when all the blood and dust have settled and you’ve found a few nice pieces of new loot to pick up out of all the viscera. <em>Diablo IV</em> nails that experience, delivering it over and over and over again and activating a part of our lizard brains that few games can.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Yes, the updates and endgame content have been a frustrating roller coaster, but the core game is fantastic, one of the best in 2023, and if Blizzard can nail future updates and expansions, it might end up being a game I put a lot of time into in 2024 and beyond. <br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>ZZ</strong></p>\n\n<aside class=\"sc-1c7snby-0 gGJizi\"></aside><hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 cvXwRv\">\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h4866\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>6. <em>Super Mario Bros.

Most <em>Mario</em> power-ups are available in multiple levels, like the Super Leaf or the Fire Flower. Some are more rare, like the Tanooki and Frog Suits that you only stumble upon every once in a while. But the boot, canonically known as Kuribo’s Shoe, appears in exactly one stage in the entire game: World 5, Level 3.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> feels like the development team said, <em>what if we made every level the boot level?</em> Each individual stage has its own unique gimmick—and often two, thanks to the way the game’s hallmark Wonder Seeds allow for an alternate route to completing the level. You can swim through the sky in rivers of torrential rain, transform into a blob to move effortlessly through bricks of slime, and bounce along a rainbow of musical notes as Piranha Plants vibe to the beat.

The result is a fast-paced action game in a captivating future-scape with deep customization and unforgettable boss fights. <em>Armored Core VI</em> successfully sands off some of the infamously opaque franchise’s rough edges without sacrificing its steely soul.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It refreshingly dispenses with so much of the ancillary time wasters that tend to pad modern blockbusters, buckling under the weight of absurd budgets and ridiculous sales expectations, whether it benefits them or not. There’s no XP to grind, randomized loot to earn, or lists of junk to collect and craft. There sure as hell isn’t a battle pass. There’s just an arsenal of unlockable gear, a loading bay where you fine-tune your mech’s build, and arcade-style bit-sized missions that crescendo from breezy demolition-fests to brutal showdowns that reward experimentation and the patience to hone your skills.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Where other games try to be everything to everyone, <em>Armored Core VI</em>’s doesn’t dabble in extraneous nonsense. Dialogue is sparse but meaningful and linear missions capitalize on that short leash to take you on a carefully guided tour through a corporate-sponsored apocalypse. None of these things is revolutionary on its own, but the precision and polish with which they’re executed in the year 2023 is notable and feels exhilarating. Austerity can be liberating, and <em>Armored Core VI</em> is an exercise in cutting through the bullshit with a giant laser sword and looking cool-as-hell while doing it. <br><br><strong>Ethan Gach, senior reporter</strong><br></p>\n<aside class=\"sc-1c7snby-0 gGJizi\"></aside><hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 cvXwRv\">\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h4868\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>4. <em>Street Fighter 6</em>\n</h2>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"75b61df4f130dbc9e48ae8ef3d6726d4\" data-recommend-id=\"image://75b61df4f130dbc9e48ae8ef3d6726d4\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A shirtless fighter looks downward. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"75b61df4f130dbc9e48ae8ef3d6726d4\" data-recommend-id=\"image://75b61df4f130dbc9e48ae8ef3d6726d4\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A shirtless fighter looks downward. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Street Fighter 6</em> is a sublime example of how iteration is at the core of fighting game design. <em>Street Fighter V</em> came out in a rough state, though by the time Capcom ended support for it in 2022, it had come around somewhat.

Messaging around it was confusing (we were meant to get a sequel that shared a multiplayer environment with the original game, instead the original game was shut down), expectations weren’t met (<em>Overwatch 2</em> launched in quite a messy state), and the battle pass monetization shift frustrated long-time fans (self-explanatory). But 2023 was the first full year of <em>Overwatch 2</em> support, content, and gameplay, and Blizzard has made some major strides.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">At times, it felt like a two-steps-forward, one-step-back dance—we got some great crossovers, but the cosmetics were expensive, and PvE was gutted, but good, but expensive.

But what about our staff’s personal GOTY lists, the games that delighted us that maybe weren’t all brand-new titles or big-budget blockbusters, but also were fun little mobile games or shooters that got a second life?<br></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">For me, 2023 was a year of branching out. Despite still plunging hundreds of hours into <em>Overwatch 2 </em>comp, I forced myself to try and get better at<em> The New York Times’ Connections </em>word game, and challenged myself to give turn-based RPGs a go for the first time ever. I dabbled in horror, in humor, in learning some hubris. Some of these games are expected, some may surprise, but they are all my top games of 2023—in no particular order.</p>\n\n\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 cvXwRv\">\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h162945\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong><em>New York Times’ Connections</em></strong>\n</h2>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"e4f29a31d71fef987cec1b42f650a859\" data-recommend-id=\"image://e4f29a31d71fef987cec1b42f650a859\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1310\" data-height=\"736\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A woman scratches her head in front of the NYT Connections logo. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"e4f29a31d71fef987cec1b42f650a859\" data-recommend-id=\"image://e4f29a31d71fef987cec1b42f650a859\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1310\" data-height=\"736\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A woman scratches her head in front of the NYT Connections logo. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">A few months ago, the daily <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/nyt-connections-hint-fie-crossword-1850941717\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/nyt-connections-hint-fie-crossword-1850941717\"><em>New York Times’ Connections </em>puzzle was a consistent hit to my self-esteem</a></span>.

The silly physics, the absurd weapons, the over-the-top announcers—it all offers up a low-stakes, high-fun experience that’s like snacking on a bag of Sour Patch kids (watermelon, of course).

The hack-and-slash combat, the sexy devil lady, the endless quest for better loot, it all scratched an itch I never really knew I had.

Playing <em>The Last of Us </em>had completely shifted my professional trajectory, and I wanted to believe that the rest of the world held games in as high regard as I did. I wanted to share my enthusiasm and desire for a better industry with others. But lately, it doesn’t feel like anyone values <em>anything</em>. Thousands of developers <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/microsoft-ea-ubisoft-layoffs-game-dev-jobs-recession-1850467429\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/microsoft-ea-ubisoft-layoffs-game-dev-jobs-recession-1850467429\">have been laid off in 2023 alone</a></span>, the <em>Kotaku </em>staff who was here when I started only a year ago has shrunk by more than half a dozen, both due to layoffs and dissatisfaction, and yet, I see millions of people show up to read <em>Kotaku </em>anyway. So clearly, someone out there still cares, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Even with the readers tuning into what we do here, shit still feels bleak sometimes. And when despair overtakes me, it’s hard for me to be optimistic or enthusiastic about anything. We want to play, read about, discuss, and elevate games, but somehow, every facet of how we interact with these miracles of programming is crumbling around us. There’s a distinct gap between the things we want and the things we get in this life, and if I knew that before, I really can’t stop thinking about it in 2023.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">So what am I supposed to do with a Game of the Year list? I’m not about to parrot some notion of how “great” a year it was for video games when it was so obviously not that. Calling it such would be an insult to the devastation everyone is experiencing right now. I guess it’s worth celebrating whatever joys we can find as the building is on fire. Sure. I‘ll do that. I played a lot of games in 2023 that did more than hold my attention; they defined how I coped with a year that felt like it did nothing but take pieces from me. Several of them were reminders of my own personhood when everything around me threatened to depersonalize all my hopes, dreams, and beliefs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I don’t know.

By focusing on Kratos over an overwhelmingly large cast, exploring his inner turmoil about what it means to be a god after every awful thing he’s done, and framing his introspection as a rewarding and challenging roguelite, <em>Valhalla </em>cuts out all the glut that kept <em>Ragnarök</em>’s best moments from shining through. I’d give it a spot on my list if I wasn’t already committed at this point. But if you haven’t played <em>Valhalla </em>yet, boot the game up again and start it now.

Since the original 3DS game kicked it off in 2016, the <em>Detective Pikachu </em>subseries has shown a different side of the <em>Pokémon </em>universe that has always been more interesting to me than competitive battling. As an adventure game, <em>Detective Pikachu Returns </em>explores Ryme City, where people and pocket monsters co-exist as equals.

I didn’t get to grow up with a queer friend group where we experienced that collective understanding.

You can only do so much and meet so many people, and you have to make the most of it instead of wallowing in what’s beyond changing.

As you make decisions about what the group will do on their excursion, it becomes clear someone’s going to be left wanting, and the fallout remains one of the most gripping and terrifying finales I experienced all year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Those frightening twists and climaxes are what make <em>Mediterranea Inferno </em>scarier than the average horror game. The fact that I see parts of my own insecurities, needs, wants, resentments, and fears in <em>Mediterranea Inferno</em>’s existential drama is terrifying because it’s a reminder of how love, belonging, and connection are human needs just as much as food, water, or air. What does a person become when they’re starving, dehydrated, or suffocating? They become desperate. And desperation is at the root of so many tragedies.</p>\n<aside class=\"sc-1c7snby-0 gGJizi\"></aside>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"c58677085162d31afc776f4fe59b8323\" data-recommend-id=\"image://c58677085162d31afc776f4fe59b8323\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The princess towers over the player while shackled against the wall.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"c58677085162d31afc776f4fe59b8323\" data-recommend-id=\"image://c58677085162d31afc776f4fe59b8323\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The princess towers over the player while shackled against the wall.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h90269\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>4. <em>Slay the Princess</em></strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Black Tabby Games’ time loop horror visual novel <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/slay-the-princess-review-black-tabby-games-horror-1851000305\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/slay-the-princess-review-black-tabby-games-horror-1851000305\"><em>Slay the Princess </em>was my biggest surprise of the year</a></span>, and I wish more of my coworkers here at <em>Kotaku </em>got around to it so I could yell about it more. It starts simple enough: You’re seemingly an amnesiac who’s been tasked with killing a princess who will, allegedly, destroy the entire world if she escapes her prison in a remote cabin basement. You can interrogate your narrating guide all you want, but in the end, you’re still expected to drive a blade through her heart and save everyone. Whether you do that or not is all up to you, but one way or another, you or the princess will die after you make the descent to her prison.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But that’s not the last chance you’ll get to slay the princess. With every attempt to kill her, you’ll wake up again in the same spot outside the cabin, ready to do it all over again. But the princess takes on different appearances and personas each time you meet her. She can appear as a bestial monster, a terrifying doll, or she can just be a young woman who is as confused about things as you are. With each loop, both of your natures become more clear, and the same is true of the alleged world-ending cataclysm you’ve been sent to stop. But <em>Slay the Princess</em> isn’t really about the many lives and deaths of a princess and her assassin. It’s about how both of them unravel every variation of who they <em>could </em>be to find out who they are.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Slay the Princess </em>is built upon the assumptions we have about one another. It structures a time loop around hearsay, presumptions, and two people expected to act upon those with minimal information. Between the dozens of times I walked down the stairs of the cabin and tried to slay the princess, I saw her take on monstrous forms, but most of the time? She was just a person. She was confused, angry, loving, and curious like anyone else. I spent so much time unraveling everything I’d been told about her, and it took time to find out who she really was. <em>Slay the Princess</em>’ greatest horror is the fear of being perceived and the vulnerability it takes to let yourself be known. But once you’re finished slashing at each other’s throats to protect yourself, that’s when the real understanding begins.</p>\n\n<aside class=\"sc-1c7snby-0 gGJizi\"></aside><figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"8f1fb0fa8fdef48f8d51e13c9222b32d\" data-recommend-id=\"image://8f1fb0fa8fdef48f8d51e13c9222b32d\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Ryu is seen shirtless and working with others and clearly being the only one who isn\'t straining himself.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"8f1fb0fa8fdef48f8d51e13c9222b32d\" data-recommend-id=\"image://8f1fb0fa8fdef48f8d51e13c9222b32d\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Ryu is seen shirtless and working with others and clearly being the only one who isn\'t straining himself.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h90270\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>3. <em>Street Fighter 6</em></strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Every day I wish I could go back to <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-review-world-tour-story-mode-roster-1850481281\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-review-world-tour-story-mode-roster-1850481281\"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a></span><em> </em>like I did when it first came out.

Universal additions like the Drive Gauge fill out offensive and defensive abilities for every character while letting Capcom experiment with unique movesets in the in-between, even with long-established mainstays. But <em>Street Fighter 6 </em>isn’t just a return to form for the series’ core mechanics and features, it’s also such a stellar encapsulation of its signature swagger and style. Each character oozes personality, and the paint-style visual effects makes every stoic fist, elegant kick, and devastating throw pop on-screen.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I tend to hop between fighting games as years go by. Though I have my favorites, they usually occupy maybe a year or so of my time before becoming a game I just have fond memories of. I’m not looking to compete in EVO anytime soon, but <em>Street Fighter 6 </em>is the kind of game that can get me to a local competition. Maybe it’s time I head back into the lobby. There are Hadoukens that need to be thrown.</p>\n\n<aside class=\"sc-1c7snby-0 gGJizi\"></aside><figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"7445f31a0550d5e5e58ce11f8a8fe860\" data-recommend-id=\"image://7445f31a0550d5e5e58ce11f8a8fe860\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"V stares into the camera.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"7445f31a0550d5e5e58ce11f8a8fe860\" data-recommend-id=\"image://7445f31a0550d5e5e58ce11f8a8fe860\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"V stares into the camera.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h90271\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>2. <em>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty</em></strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I don’t think a game has ever turned me around like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. In 2020, I had a begrudging respect for some (most certainly not all) of its writing and characters, and Night City was gorgeous when it wasn’t at risk of falling apart. But now, after the 2.0 update and <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-update-review-idris-elba-1850852291\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-update-review-idris-elba-1850852291\"><em>Phantom Liberty </em>expansion</a></span>, I think I’m comfortable saying I love <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. Somehow, a game I only played out of a work obligation three years ago has become incredibly important to me.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Phantom Liberty </em>is fairly separate from most of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>’s story, bringing in its own characters, stories, and <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-new-ending-phantom-liberty-misty-v-lives-1850899228\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-new-ending-phantom-liberty-misty-v-lives-1850899228\">ending while derailing the original plot</a></span>. But even so, it is constantly reflecting on how V, its mercenary protagonist, got to where they are. The reflective story feels like a look back at how <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>got here, as well. After selling millions of copies of a broken game, you get a second chance to get it right.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">As someone who was there for all of it, the mess of a launch, the next-gen update, and the 2.0 patch that gutted and retooled the entire game, <em>Phantom Liberty </em>feels like relaxing a tense muscle after years. I can recommend the game without that many caveats and can have a conversation about why V’s story of a nobody becoming somebody in the city he loves <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-night-city-new-york-city-1850879791\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-night-city-new-york-city-1850879791\">resonates with me as someone who spent his entire life clawing to find a place he called home</a></span>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> is confounding and frustrating, and somehow has ascended in the list of games I hold most dear. <em>Phantom Liberty </em>is both a victory lap for a game that embodies the worst tendencies of excess in this industry, and a reality check for the systemic issues in how games are made. In the end, what’s left standing after all this carnage is a pretty great RPG with a moving story about what we live for, and <em>Phantom Liberty </em>is a testament to the best parts of it.</p>\n<aside class=\"sc-1c7snby-0 gGJizi\"></aside>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"b8b8282a535c3f2ee351ad24f3c63530\" data-recommend-id=\"image://b8b8282a535c3f2ee351ad24f3c63530\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Shep and Gale sit underneath the stars.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"b8b8282a535c3f2ee351ad24f3c63530\" data-recommend-id=\"image://b8b8282a535c3f2ee351ad24f3c63530\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Shep and Gale sit underneath the stars.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h90272\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>1. <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s been a while since a video game got me in that fanfiction-level brainrot.

I’ve been thinking about writing a story about how, before Larian’s RPG, Shep and Arendelle were lovers in Avernus, one of the layers of Hell in the Forgotten Realms. And I was thinking, what if Shep became a Warlock in an effort to get Arendelle out of Avernus and into…wait, sorry, we were talking about Game of the Year. My bad, I get distracted and fall down the <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> hole if I think about it too long.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Choice-based RPGs are always about self-expression to me. We create characters, make decisions, and craft our builds, all in the name of injecting a piece of ourselves into worlds like <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>’s take on Faerûn. As a video game, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>is always going to be beholden to some code that the team at Larian is able to put together, but I don’t think I’ve seen a game of this scale feel so open to me. My Warlock is a canvas on which I paint all my favorite colors, scribble my deepest desires, tattoo my views on his heart, and shape him into the closest facsimile of me I can. His Eldritch Blast cantrip is the tool with which I fight for what I believe in, the arms with which I hug my best friend Karlach after her infernal engine has cooled, and the hand I use to hold the magical hands of my lover Gale.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"892604f7629a60605c8cf9f04f67a0d2\" data-recommend-id=\"image://892604f7629a60605c8cf9f04f67a0d2\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The Guardian shows Shep something in the Astral Plane.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"892604f7629a60605c8cf9f04f67a0d2\" data-recommend-id=\"image://892604f7629a60605c8cf9f04f67a0d2\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The Guardian shows Shep something in the Astral Plane.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I recognize how long it’s been since I had a game that let me insert myself into an RPG world like this. But <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>’s density, reactivity, and near-boundless depth have probably made me feel more rewarded than any other game just for expressing myself in every decision, big and small. I wear Karlach’s armor made of belts because I want to dress slutty, even as I’m trying to fight fantastical monstrosities. I specialize in charisma because I want to talk my way out of as many situations as possible instead of relying on my patron’s “gifts.” I pursue Gale as I try to bring him back to reality, lest he, like my Warlock, fall from grace as he reaches for new ambitions.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Everything I do in <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, whether it’s world-shattering or just what I chose to wear that day, feels significant because those decisions are mine, and they <em>feel</em> like they’re mine. It’s one thing for a game to offer you the freedom to fuck around in an open-world map, blowing up shit and murdering civilians just because you can. But <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>’s willingness to weave that freedom into its game design is why I feel more ownership of everything I’ve done in Larian Studio’s stunning achievement. Yes, one day, when everyone’s wrung it dry and scoured its code, we’ll know the limits of what we can do. But for now, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> is the closest I’ve ever felt to actually existing in a video game’s fantastical world. As the possibilities of where my story could go continue to fuel my desire to expand upon them further in my own writing, I’ll exist in it a little while longer.</p>\n\n\n<aside class=\"sc-1c7snby-0 gGJizi\"></aside>', '2024-03-11 11:35:02', '2024-03-11 11:35:02', 'Baldur\'s Gate 3 to Pokémon: Kenneth Shepard’s Most Spellbinding Games Of 2023', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/93faddb3fc6e10518b6e30fc27d0d3e2.jpg', 'year-in-review', 'https://kotaku.com/best-video-games-2023-baldurs-gate-3-cyberpunk-sf6-1851113163', 'Damn, what a year 2023 was, huh?\nWhen I started writing about video games in 201...', ''),

In 2022, it felt like Xbox wasn’t able to fulfill that order, relying heavily on third-party games to fill in the Game Pass cracks left behind by delaying <em>Starfield </em>and <em>Redfall</em>. Yet every few months in 2023 a big new game, often a first-party title, joined Game Pass’s large library.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Despite the improved flow of first-party exclusives, Microsoft didn’t stop cutting deals to get third-party games on Game Pass in 2023.

So with the service hitting a ceiling and unable to grow its userbase, the company will seek to raise prices to squeeze more out of the folks it has.

It’s no secret that the smaller, weaker next-gen console has been a huge seller for Microsoft. In 2023, capitalizing on this success, it released a newer version of its all-digital mini-console that came packaged with a bigger internal SSD.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">And I’ll be the first to admit that the Xbox Series S is often a fantastic device. I use mine a lot when I’m chilling in my living room and don’t want to get up and go play games in my home office. But the micro machine’s popularity has also meant that <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-series-x-s-ps5-slim-baldur-s-gate-3-1850770111\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-series-x-s-ps5-slim-baldur-s-gate-3-1850770111\">Microsoft is sort of stuck with the thing</a></span> and in 2023 it felt like we saw the first tangible signs that this could be a problem moving into 2024 and beyond.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Games are starting to struggle with performance on it, with devs having to cut more corners to get games to run acceptably on the weaker Xbox.

And for smaller and less graphically impressive games, the Series S will be more than enough. But it’s impossible to ignore that in 2023 the less capable next-gen Xbox model was starting to show the strain, holding stuff back in a way that makes me worried about the future.<br></p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h84954\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Xbox, Activision, and the future of Game Pass</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Without a doubt, the biggest news for Xbox in 2023 was the <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-game-pass-1850923561\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-game-pass-1850923561\">official acquisition of Activision Blizzard King</a></span>, aka the company behind <em>Call of Duty, Warcraft, Candy Crush</em>, and much more.

Absorbing that many employees that quickly is tricky, and if you don’t think layoffs are coming at some point, well, you’re a bigger optimist than I.

Maybe. Maybe not. But I can guarantee you that in a few years, Game Pass will be in more places and it will be easier than ever to play the latest <em>Call of Duty</em> entry, regardless of your platform. That sounds nice, though what it will cost to get there—in jobs, in increased prices, and in less competition—doesn’t seem worth it. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"> .<br></p>', '2024-03-11 11:35:02', '2024-03-11 11:35:02', 'The State Of Xbox And Game Pass In 2023', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/b47130e9c606bd4180e227f7fa8aea2b.jpg', 'year-in-review', 'https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-series-x-s-2023-call-of-duty-game-pass-1851108720', 'On paper, Microsoft did what it needed to do in 2023 to improve on a quiet, some...', ''),

From just having a great time with invading relatives, to bonding with your children, it’s a boundary-breaking, age-gap traversing activity. Also, it’s an excellent way to fill up the aching stretch of endless Sundays in the back half of December.

There are top-quality family-friendly games that are as fun for the grown-ups as they are the kids. Sure, the short idiots <em>think</em> they want to play <em>Paw Patrol</em>-labelled nonsense, but we can steer them right.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The following is a selection of games from which you will hopefully find something that meets your specific needs, whether that’s busying super-young kids, or finding something that’ll simultaneously entertain Gram-gram <em>and</em> the teens. </p>', '2024-03-11 11:35:02', '2024-03-11 11:35:02', 'The 9 Best Games To Play With Family This Holiday', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/dcb2f879275798b68fd416bc34af4d71.jpg', 'year-in-review', 'https://kotaku.com/best-family-video-games-lego-skywalker-saga-mario-kart-1851107249', 'There are so many good reasons to play video games with your family.

Another $200 accessory, it’s basically a DualSense with an LCD screen wedged in-between. There’s an Android OS, but no functionality outside of streaming games from an existing PS5, the results of which are decent but vary depending on WiFi speed.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s the perfect boondoggle for grinding out PlayStation trophies in bed, during football games, or while the kids are watching <em>Bluey</em>. The question remains, however, why didn’t Sony go the extra mile and make a more capable handheld that could also stream games from the cloud, or even play some natively? Maybe one is coming in the future. Or maybe the Portal is proof that while every other company is racing to make its own version of the Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck, Sony is content to never once again dare to fumble portable gaming as badly as it did with the PS Vita.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Sony concluded 2023 with a slight refresh of the PS5 itself. <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ps5-slim-comparison-teardown-1850994766\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ps5-slim-comparison-teardown-1850994766\">A new “slim” version</a></span> is 30 percent lighter and comes with a swappable disc drive and a full 1TB SSD instead of the launch edition’s 800GB one.

This was the year some big firmware updates brought over those improvements, as well as plenty of new ones. While headlined by the addition of Discord integration, <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/ps5-discord-sony-save-data-transfer-ps4-firmware-update-1850238845\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/ps5-discord-sony-save-data-transfer-ps4-firmware-update-1850238845\">March’s 7.0 update</a></span> streamlined things across the board, from notifications for when you have existing save data for a game in the cloud to less friction when trying to view and join friends’ gaming sessions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Game folders, the big addition last year, received the ability to filter games too in 2021. Choosing which games to add is one of those small but meaningful tweaks that makes managing a growing digital library less of a chore. <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/playstation-update-beta-ps5-beep-settings-turn-off-1850691531\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/playstation-update-beta-ps5-beep-settings-turn-off-1850691531\">A September update</a></span> added even more features, including the ability to search folders and finally turn off the beeping sounds whenever the PS5 turns on. The PlayStation Store also became friendlier, adding accessibility tags to let players know which games have which customization options before they buy.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"6c1ba98b0ad579b57a068b4c10aa9877\" data-recommend-id=\"image://6c1ba98b0ad579b57a068b4c10aa9877\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot shows UI changes to PS5. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"6c1ba98b0ad579b57a068b4c10aa9877\" data-recommend-id=\"image://6c1ba98b0ad579b57a068b4c10aa9877\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot shows UI changes to PS5. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Plenty of headaches remain, though. There’s no way to add folders directly to the main row of icons on the home screen, and lots of settings and features are still buried beneath too many unintuitive button presses. Social features are pegged to the <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/games/customize-ps5-control-center/\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/games/customize-ps5-control-center/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Control Center</a></span> that pops up when you press the home button, while managing data storage and other key functions are cordoned off in the top right of the home menu.

You can only initiate “campaigns” to earn coins redeemable for PSN cash from the app, and the collectibles you unlock can’t be viewed on PS5 either. It’s a neat idea that’s still incomplete, similar to Activity Cards, the console’s tool for keeping track of discrete challenges within a game and helping you complete them more efficiently.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The cards were great in <em>Spider-Man 2</em>, letting players warp around the map even quicker than the in-game fast-travel system to clean up those last few side-missions and collectibles. Implementation in non-first-party games is uneven though, and the cards aren’t always cleanly laid out and organized. Like Sony’s scattershot approach to hardware and accessories, the interface is full of good ideas that aren’t necessarily all pulling in the same direction. It’s messy, and in need of a more foundational overhaul than just another set of new features and tweaks. In the meantime, I’d love for trophy lists to stop defaulting to hidden even after I’ve revealed them and to finally be able to add folders to the home screen.</p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h5644\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>The Network and Services</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Last year was the big PlayStation Plus revamp. This year Sony continued adding PlayStation classics to the subscription services’ back catalog and finally implemented cloud streaming for many of the PS5’s biggest games. It also dramatically raised the price of each tier of the new program, making it feel like a good time to really consider whether renting a vast library of games every month is better than just paying to own the ones you actually want to play outright.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/sony-ps-plus-ps5-game-pass-price-spider-man-2-starfield-1850787462\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/sony-ps-plus-ps5-game-pass-price-spider-man-2-starfield-1850787462\">The annual prices</a></span> went from $60 to $80 for Essential, $100 to $135 for Extra, and $120 to $160 for Premium. The bottom tier added plenty of great games this year, from<em> Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</em> and<em> OlliOlliWorld</em> to <em>Death’s Door</em> and <em>Callisto Protocol</em>. The Extra tier’s Netflix-like library circulated in heavy hitters as well, from<em> Devil May Cry 5</em> and <em>Borderlands 3</em> to <em>Destiny 2: The Witch Queen</em> and <em>Grand Theft Auto 5</em>. There were some notable day-and-date releases on the service too, like the PS5 version of <em>Rogue Legacy 2</em> and the SNES-style RPG <em>Sea of Stars</em>. And Sony continued adding older first-party exclusives to the back catalog, like <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> and <em>Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The most expensive Premium tier was less impressive. Sony recently began rolling out cloud streaming on PS5, an additional perk that makes it easy to try a game before buying it or get started before finishing the download. Unfortunately, the performance, at least in my limited experience, isn’t great yet.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"5dcc8f68cb0ed1215e09b3406556b6b6\" data-recommend-id=\"image://5dcc8f68cb0ed1215e09b3406556b6b6\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1855\" data-height=\"1044\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Final Fantasy XVI\'s Joshua tells his brother to delete his subs. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"5dcc8f68cb0ed1215e09b3406556b6b6\" data-recommend-id=\"image://5dcc8f68cb0ed1215e09b3406556b6b6\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1855\" data-height=\"1044\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Final Fantasy XVI\'s Joshua tells his brother to delete his subs. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">And the trickling out of PlayStation Classics, the main draw of the Premium tier for hardcore fans and retro enthusiasts, remains slow and full of random games that aren’t that exciting. Some months there are great additions like <em>The Legend of Dragoon</em> and <em>Grandia</em>. Other months, we get games like<em> Ape Escape: On the Loose</em>, the PSP remake of the original game which was already on the service. Some months no classics get added at all. Given that Sony sells them separately in the store anyway, anyone subscribed to Premium waiting for their favorite PS1, PS2, or PSP game would be better served by saving their money and just waiting until it’s available to buy.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">At a time when rising prices are prompting everyone to reevaluate <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/game-pass-ps-plus-disney-netflix-spotify-price-cancel-1850848468\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/game-pass-ps-plus-disney-netflix-spotify-price-cancel-1850848468\">what subscriptions are actually worth holding onto</a></span>, PlayStation Plus, feels harder than ever to justify—unless there’s a live-service multiplayer game you log into regularly, in which case it’s mandatory. The program keeps getting more complicated without actually getting much better in terms of value. As an example, Sony recently announced a rebrand of its movie streaming app and that PS Plus Premium subscribers would get access to a library of up to 100 movies.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Before you get too excited, the list included things ranging from <em>Looper</em> to <em>Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV</em>. It’s hard to know just how good of a deal this will end up being, but it doesn’t feel like the “super bundle” other services are chasing. I can see a future where Sony adds Funimation and Crunchyroll to PS Plus to sweeten the deal.

On the Sony front, there was the unsurprising but technically impressive PS VR2 launch title <em>Horizon: Call of the Mountain</em> in February. <em>Forbidden West</em>’s expansion, <em>Burning Shores</em>, an epilogue to the sci-fi open-world game that delivered PS5-exclusive visual effects and one hell of a final boss fight, followed in April.

It feels like Sony is getting dressed up for a party that’s already over.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Outgoing Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ps5-ps-vr2-spider-man-2-cloud-gaming-1850469726\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ps5-ps-vr2-spider-man-2-cloud-gaming-1850469726\">laid out bold plans for PlayStation’s growth this year</a></span>. Roughly half of all games would be live-service and half would be on PC and mobile. In fact, 2023 was supposed to see Sony’s first new mobile release as part of this effort. Tons of console games came to PC, including the initially beleaguered port of <em>The Last of Us Part I,</em> but so far there’s been no big smartphone release, even as third-party games like <em>Genshin Impact</em> and<em> Honkai: Star Rail</em> continue to bridge the gap between the big-budget console and mobile gaming experience.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Sony held only one big future-looking gaming showcase this year, back in May. It highlighted upcoming live service games from recently acquired studios. Haven, made up of Ubisoft veterans, is making the heist-inspired shooter <em>FairGame$</em>. Firewalk Studios debuted <em>Concord</em>, a sci-fi space game we still know basically nothing about. The only major first-party single-player game currently announced is <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/its-wolverines-turn-for-a-big-budget-video-game-1847646598\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/its-wolverines-turn-for-a-big-budget-video-game-1847646598\">Insomniac’s <em>Wolverine</em></a></span>. It’s unusual for Sony to be so quiet about what’s coming in the near future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The big question when any new console arrives is what new franchises it will usher in. PS3 saw the creation of <em>Infamous</em> and <em>Uncharted</em>. PS4 saw the creation of <em>Horizon</em> and the <em>God of War</em> reboot. Three years in, we still don’t really have any idea what will be the great new worlds or stories built exclusively for the PS5, let alone when they’ll arrive. Next year is set to get off to a strong start with <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-remastered-roguelike-no-return-ps5-1851073641\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-remastered-roguelike-no-return-ps5-1851073641\"><em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</em></a></span> in January, <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-state-of-play-e3-2022-showcase-present-1849011711\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-state-of-play-e3-2022-showcase-present-1849011711\"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a></span><em> </em>in February, and <em>Rise of the Ronin</em> in March. But PlayStation will likely need some other big tricks up its sleeve to fill in the potential gaps left by all of the big multiplatform games that already came out this year.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The PS5 has never been easier to recommend, but whether because of the pandemic, scattered initiatives pulling in too many directions, or both, it feels like the console is losing momentum as Sony figures out what’s next and how to make that work. One thing that might help: a brand-new upgraded console. <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ps5-pro-could-launch-in-2024-with-sonys-own-dlss-solution-its-claimed/\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ps5-pro-could-launch-in-2024-with-sonys-own-dlss-solution-its-claimed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rumors continue to swirl</a></span> about a PS5 Pro with beefier specs that will help deliver on some of the promises of this generation like consistent 60fps modes and ray-traced graphics.

The kids are not alright. But despite the painful emotional journey its child soldiers must go on, which is portrayed with the emotional maturity and complexity it deserves, the game is not without some great moments of levity as well, courtesy of some lighthearted and silly sidequests.

Big shoes to fill, I know. <em>Signalis</em> not only manages to fill those shoes, it damn near tore the seams off of them joints with how bloody good it was. I’d even argue that it’s better than <em>Silent Hill 2</em>.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Signalis </em>has all the bells and whistles that make for a good sci-fi survival horror game. It’s got a brutal-but-fair limited inventory system, brain-teasing puzzles, and breadcrumb storytelling conveyed through codex entries scattered about its levels.

Elster’s sole mission is to reunite with Anne, a fellow android unit she both literally and figuratively can’t live without. <em>Signalis </em>sticks its landing with the emotional climax of Elster’s perilous journey, regardless of which of the game’s multiple endings you arrive at. This feat is even more impressive considering <em>Signalis </em>is the first video game made by its two-person development team, rose-engine.

Like Cardboard Computer’s masterpiece, <em>Norco </em>also takes its cues from point-and-click adventures, using stunning pixel art to pull us into its industrialized Louisiana landscapes. And where <em>KR0 </em>lent its midwestern road trip a heaping helping of magical realism, <em>Norco </em>uses near-future sci-fi elements to cast the forces its poor, marginalized characters face in sharper relief.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/game-pass-norco-review-adventure-southern-gothic-raw-fu-1848726472\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/game-pass-norco-review-adventure-southern-gothic-raw-fu-1848726472\">A Stunning Southern Dystopia Is One Of The Best-Written Games Of The Year</a></span><br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But don’t let my easy comparison make you think <em>Norco </em>is a pale imitator of another game. It’s very much its own remarkable experience, one with its own visual identity, its own poetic voice, and its own noir-ish mystery. Everything about <em>Norco </em>rings painfully true, from its observant little environmental details like the electrified hum of a street light, to the much larger way that religion, cryptocurrency, and the oil industry all become woven together in the haunting texture of your character’s search for her missing brother. Norco, Louisiana is a real place. The Norco of this game is not quite that place, but it’s nevertheless one that feels very real in its own way, and that will leave you reeling from the piercing gaze it levels at the world we’ve made for ourselves. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>Carolyn Petit, Managing Editor</strong></p>\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 cvXwRv\">\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h567406\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>7.

Twice now, her adventures have been somewhat overshadowed at the time of release by other games that more dramatically captured the world’s attention. Her first outing, <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, launched just a few days before <em>Breath of the Wild</em>. This year, her second quest was followed a week later by <em>Elden Ring</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But despite repeatedly serving as the opening act for games that go on to sweep the GOTYs of a hundred gaming sites, Guerrilla Games and Aloy can be proud of what they’ve accomplished. Arguably the most visually stunning game of the year, Guerrilla’s latest takes Aloy into the ruined American west for more of the thrilling, spectacular battles with hulking metallic beasts that helped make the first game an original in a sea of samey open-world blockbusters. And although the larger narrative may fly a bit off the rails in this outing, <em>Forbidden West </em>wisely stays focused on Aloy’s personal journey as someone who feels the weight of the world on her shoulders and doesn’t know how to let her guard down and allow her friends to carry that burden with her. It complicates her character and trusts us as players not to turn on her the moment she behaves in ways that are arrogant, cruel, or misguided. Oh, and you get a really sweet new travel option near the end of the game, too.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"> Yes, when all is said and done, Aloy and her escapades can stand tall alongside the Links and the myriad Tarnished of the world.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>Carolyn Petit, Managing Editor</strong></p>\n\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 cvXwRv\">\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h567407\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>6.

Yet, here I was hunched over my computer focused on shaving just one more second off a level in <em>Neon White</em> so I could beat a friend on my leaderboard. That’s the power of fast-paced, FPS platformer <em>Neon White</em>. It’s the kind of game that feels so good that you just can’t stop playing it. Once you get skilled enough to start finding shortcuts in levels, it’s over–the game has you at that point. You’ll end up going back to old levels you thought you mastered to shave off more time. And if you enjoy anime nonsense, angels, demons, and sick-ass music, too, then <em>Neon White</em> will dig its angelic claws deeply into you and never let go. “One more run…and then I’ll go to bed.” I didn’t get to sleep that night until nearly 4:30 am.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>Zack Zwiezen, Staff Writer</strong></p>\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 cvXwRv\">\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h567408\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>5.

But what stands out as the glisten on the diamond is the character development between daddy Kratos and adolescent Atreus, an element that sees the co-protagonists finding common understanding in the face of the end of the world.

Many <em>Kotaku</em> staff members ranked it as their number one game of the year, and for good reason.

It found a perfect balance between that punishing gameplay so many long for in a game from this studio and a newfound sense of agency, of a chance to<em> </em>get gud without having to run into the same noxious swamp over and over again.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Elden Ring</em> is technically impressive, visually stunning, and satisfyingly challenging. It has humor, it has sadness, it has turtle popes. It dashes your hopes up against a jagged rock only to hand you hope back bit-by-bit as you strengthen your character and your resolve. It is everything that we hope for in a video game, and then some. </p>', '2024-03-11 11:35:52', '2024-03-11 11:35:52', 'Kotaku\'s Top 10 Games Of 2022', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/50fa446d7c00a3f641bdbedacbf74374.jpg', 'year-in-review', 'https://kotaku.com/goty-best-games-2022-elden-ring-god-war-ragnarok-marvel-1849934499', 'I was warned of how heated Kotaku’s GOTY arguments traditionally get when I firs...', ''),

I don’t boot up open-world RPGs very often, but throughout 2022 I would turn on <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> just to drive around the city and imagine the possibilities it held for me. Thankfully, I live in a city now, and no longer have to dream. But <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>was a lifeline during a time when the home it proposed felt unattainable. For that, I’ll always keep the story of V and Night City in my heart, even if I don’t think it’s a great video game.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 cvXwRv\">\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"f603164e47fa711808485af2030edbbb\" data-recommend-id=\"image://f603164e47fa711808485af2030edbbb\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Yu and Kay are seen laying down together next to a camping ground.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"f603164e47fa711808485af2030edbbb\" data-recommend-id=\"image://f603164e47fa711808485af2030edbbb\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Yu and Kay are seen laying down together next to a camping ground.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h553691\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>4. <em>Gayven </em>(<em>Haven</em>, but gay)</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Haven </em>completely slipped by me in 2020, but that changed this year when The Game Bakers added an update that let you play as same-sex pairings of its main characters Yu and Kay.

Where many video games thrive in the lead-up to a romantic relationship, <em>Haven </em>sits with what it means to already be well and established, and it leads to some of my favorite romance writing in a game. It’s full of big, oppressive science-fiction ideas, but its best moments are when two people sit together in their home and speak to each other not as spacefaring adventurers, but as two star-crossed lovers willing to find pockets of joy when they’re all they’ve got left.</p>\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 cvXwRv\">\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"2eccf0844e7b2c020b0eee8a32745374\" data-recommend-id=\"image://2eccf0844e7b2c020b0eee8a32745374\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Luca and Miguel are shown talking over drinks at a bar lit by neon lights.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"2eccf0844e7b2c020b0eee8a32745374\" data-recommend-id=\"image://2eccf0844e7b2c020b0eee8a32745374\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Luca and Miguel are shown talking over drinks at a bar lit by neon lights.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h553692\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>3. <em>We Are OFK</em></strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The music of <em>We Are OFK</em>, an episodic biopic about a group of young adults drifting through the L.A. game dev grind and into a musical act, nearly topped my Spotify Wrapped this year.

After years of watching the franchise add to its mythology and world, it never really felt like many of these games were living up to the promise of the universe Game Freak had built over 25 years. <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus </em>was the first time since I was a child that this setting felt as large and unknowable as it did in my youth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Much of that came from <em>Legends: Arceus</em>’ use of a historical setting, rather than the modern one seen in most other <em>Pokémon </em>games. Taking the player back to when the Sinnoh region was known as Hisui, being present for lore-defining conflicts, and watching the universe’s gods have it out was more impactful than hearing about them through historians and seeing cave paintings and statues. It felt like a second chance for Sinnoh to feel like the significant origin point of the universe it had been described as in <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">On top of just feeling more vast, <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus </em>was also the most tangible the world felt to me as a player. This was thanks to Game Freak’s shift into action-oriented mechanics like actually being able to aim and throw a Pokéball at an unsuspecting wild Pokémon, stealthing around the wilderness to avoid giant Alpha Pokémon, and being able to fluidly traverse its open areas on the backs of friendly critters. Even when <em>Pokémon Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>attempted their own versions of these systems, it never felt like they quite captured <em>Legends: Arceus</em>’ frictionless traversal, and that’s why they felt flimsy in comparison.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Legends: Arceus </em>solidified to me what it is I want out of <em>Pokémon </em>games. Some people want to capture every Pokémon in the Pokedex, some want to compete and become a respected champion. But for me, existing in this world and discovering its secrets with Raichu by my side is why <em>Pokémon </em>still holds my attention decades later, and <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus </em>is the most I’ve felt captivated by this universe, probably ever. I hope it’s a blueprint for the series’ future, because I feel like, otherwise, I’m going to be chasing the highs of its best moments for years to come.</p>', '2024-03-11 11:35:52', '2024-03-11 11:35:52', 'Kenneth Shepard\'s Top Five Games Of 2022', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/56b678ddfc70970bd75cbb403c0b927b.jpg', 'year-in-review', 'https://kotaku.com/best-games-2022-pokemon-legends-arceus-overwatch-ofk-1849935691', 'When it comes time to write these year-end lists, I usually slim them down to my...', ''),

It sounds like a meaningful upgrade from the original PlayStation VR headset Sony released in 2016, with an impressive-sounding OLED, 4K resolution display, dedicated controllers so you won’t have to use your old PlayStation Move wands anymore, and a single-cord setup that will make using the whole thing more manageable. However, as news has come out about the device, things have gotten a bit more troubling.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The most egregious drawback Sony has confirmed is that original PlayStation VR games <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/psvr2-ps5-sony-vr-beat-saber-resident-evil-1849546979\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/psvr2-ps5-sony-vr-beat-saber-resident-evil-1849546979\">won’t be compatible with the PSVR2 headset</a></span>. Senior Vice President of Platform Experience Hideaki Nishino said on the PlayStation Podcast that this is because “PSVR2 is designed to deliver a truly next generation VR experience,” citing much of the new headset’s tech as being incompatible with old PSVR games. Regardless of whatever explanation Sony has to offer, it’s a bummer that the PlayStation 5 seemed to be developed with more future-proofing in mind and now we’re dealing with backward compatibility issues again. So if you want to keep playing your old PSVR games, don’t throw your old headset out.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Oh, and the device will cost $550 when it launches on February 22 of next year, making it <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/s5-psvr2-price-release-date-horizon-call-mountain-1849731902\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/s5-psvr2-price-release-date-horizon-call-mountain-1849731902\">more expensive than the console it’s played on</a></span>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"13ec44ee81d5781a4f60d688c9211948\" data-recommend-id=\"image://13ec44ee81d5781a4f60d688c9211948\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The PlayStation Plus logo is shown with the service\'s three tiers listed below it: essential, extra, and premium.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"13ec44ee81d5781a4f60d688c9211948\" data-recommend-id=\"image://13ec44ee81d5781a4f60d688c9211948\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The PlayStation Plus logo is shown with the service\'s three tiers listed below it: essential, extra, and premium.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h570923\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>PlayStation Plus launches new tiers with new problems</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">PlayStation Plus, Sony’s long-running subscription service for playing games online and collecting a vast array of “free” games, <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/ps-plus-essential-extra-premium-ps4-ps5-ps3-games-1849060132\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/ps-plus-essential-extra-premium-ps4-ps5-ps3-games-1849060132\">saw a revamp this year</a></span> that put it more in-line with Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass.

From emotional narrative adventures to dope extreme sports simulators, this year was filled with games that captured my attention and held it long after the credits rolled.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">So, with that, here are my top nine games of 2022:</p>\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 cvXwRv\">\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h561374\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>Elden Ring</h2>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"5233015451a1ada4648a496e3df6feff\" data-recommend-id=\"image://5233015451a1ada4648a496e3df6feff\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"An Elden Ring image of two warriors battling each other atop horseback.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"5233015451a1ada4648a496e3df6feff\" data-recommend-id=\"image://5233015451a1ada4648a496e3df6feff\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"An Elden Ring image of two warriors battling each other atop horseback.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-fromsoftware-review-hidetaka-miyazaki-dark-s-1848694257\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-fromsoftware-review-hidetaka-miyazaki-dark-s-1848694257\"><em>Elden Ring</em></a></span>, FromSoftware’s magnum opus that catapulted the studio to mainstream stardom and critical acclaim. The game that won the Japanese developer a Game of the Year trophy at this year’s Keighley Awards ceremony. The project that captivated players and streamers the world over, and one I can’t stop thinking about despite not finishing it after over 100 hours exploring Limgrave and the surrounding regions. This is a difficult game, one hellbent on kicking your ass back to the nearest Site of Grace without batting an eye. But even though there’s frustration that comes with the defeat, there are no real limitations in the game on how you can tackle any given challenge. Getting stomped by the Tree Sentinel in the fields of Limegrave? You can discover totally new mysteries, level up, and come back later. Worried about the Starscourge Radahn fight? Don’t be because it’s not even required to beat the game. Hell, there are entire areas, like the Inverted Carion Study Hall hidden within Liurnia of the Lakes or the Deeprooth Depths guarded by two Gargoyles, you can stumble upon<!-- --> by hopping on your trusty stead Torrent and just going. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Elden Ring</em> is full of optional journeying like this. It’s the rare open-world game that, like <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> before it, truly gives you the freedom to explore when something becomes too challenging or tedious. It goes beyond the”you can go there” ideology games continually aspire to, and takes it a step further: places you never imagined reaching, places you couldn’t even perceive at first, were actually discoverable all along. 2022 was <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-goty-2022-dlc-fromsoftware-dark-souls-1849925353\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-goty-2022-dlc-fromsoftware-dark-souls-1849925353\">the Year of <em>Elden Ring</em></a></span>, and I believe this game will influence others to come.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h561375\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><em>Evil West</em>\n</h2>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"20aa3b287146bb5dd235f63a4ce34803\" data-recommend-id=\"image://20aa3b287146bb5dd235f63a4ce34803\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"An Evil West image of protagonist Jesse Rentier shooting a monster in the head with his back turned towards it.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"20aa3b287146bb5dd235f63a4ce34803\" data-recommend-id=\"image://20aa3b287146bb5dd235f63a4ce34803\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"An Evil West image of protagonist Jesse Rentier shooting a monster in the head with his back turned towards it.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Now here was a surprise.

A story about a teenager going through the throes of adolescence and heartbreak, this game crushed me at launch. That’s a positive thing since it’s an experience that’s stuck with me long after I rolled the credits. Its writing is earnest and relatable, its characterization is believable and honest, and its narrative is affecting and intimate especially for ‘90s kids who grew up with the then-nascent internet. Meredith has a captivating way of transporting you to protagonist Mara Whitefish’s remote island of Perfect Tides, an idyllic archipelago surrounded by sands and water, a perfect summery resort with fuck-all to do. Although it’s an entirely fictional setting, the familiarity of the residents and the situations everyone finds themselves in are plausible—almost as if Meredith has lived my exact life.

Plus there’s couch co-op, a facet of game design that’s slowly dying with the advent of always-online games. <em>Shredder’s Revenge</em> is relatively short, taking all of maybe three hours to beat if you’re rushing, but there’s enough depth and variety here to extend that upwards of 18 hours.

I mean, fuck…this game made me tear up on several occasions, whether it was the lyrics in the songs that played at the end of each episode or the character interactions between the four protagonists. While the structure of the game is a bit weird—it’s one part point-and-click adventure, another part playable album—the storytelling and themes of <em>We Are OFK</em> are gut-wrenchingly relatable. From the desire to live your authentic truth under the crushing weight of capitalism to maintaining friendships while chasing after your creative aspirations, <em>We Are OFK</em> asks you to sit with the protagonists as they figure their shit out—just like we all are. This is a game that demands attention and requires patience, especially after completing each roughly one-hour episode.

While heavy hitters like <em>God of War: Ragnarok</em>, <em>Elden Ring</em>, or <em>Destiny 2</em>’s <em>The Witch Queen </em>expansion are likely to have their praises sung the loudest, there were also games like Obsidians’ <em>Pentiment </em>that are equally deserving of our attention. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Pentiment</em> is a work of interactive historical fiction and though the game might be the most rewarding for history wonks, its historical grounding and well-written NPCs (who never feel like they exist just to spout history lessons) make it one of this year’s best storytelling accomplishments. We sat down with Josh Sawyer, <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>, <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>, and <em>Pentiment</em>’s director, to chat about how the team wove history and narrative so seamlessly into its characters.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Pentiment </em>is a murder mystery set in the late 16th century. The historical premise and detective plot is appealing on its own, but it’s the natural interactions with various NPCs that keep me glued to this game. Everyone feels distinctly real, with purpose and knowledge, and serve to sketch the historical background of the fictional town of Tassing specifically, but also late medieval Europe. It is both a history lesson and a character study, and engrossing the whole way through.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/pentiment-review-impressions-obsidian-xbox-gamepass-rpg-1849774671\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/pentiment-review-impressions-obsidian-xbox-gamepass-rpg-1849774671\">This Killer Narrative Game From Obsidian Is A Must-Play</a></span></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Speaking with <em>Kotaku</em>, director Josh Sawyer describes the process of choosing who to deliver what historical lessons as an important facet of world and character building. It wasn’t enough for <em>Pentiment</em> to simply make sure each character would have a justifiable reason for their knowledge. A character’s personal interests and who they are in the world is also taken into account, and that shapes, when, where, and how they tell their stories </p>\n<blockquote data-type=\"BlockQuote\" class=\"sc-8hxd3p-0 cfcqyq\"><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">“It’s actually been a challenge for a lot of my career, and so something over the last few games that I’ve worked on is when characters are going to essentially engage in exposition, my question usually to the writer is ‘why is this character the character to tell the story?’ Because if the answer is ‘well, we need someone to tell it,’ that’s not a good answer.”</p></blockquote>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Sawyer continues: “The [exposition] that’s being told has to mean something that’s really important to the person telling it. And I think that is probably why people feel like it feels more natural than, for example if you’re in a history class, or a social studies class, and someone’s kind of lecturing at you.” </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">An example Sawyer gives is Til Kreutzer, one of <em>Pentiment</em>’s characters who readily talks of the world’s history—particularly that of the Romans who predate this period.. But that knowledge must come from somewhere important to the character. Through the game we learn that he had been given access to the church’s library, access that he no longer has. Combined with where he works, Til becomes a natural source of worldbuilding for Tassing (establishing his history with the church) as well as the history of the region.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"c4c00d536d51f8b2fbba2051f94ab094\" data-recommend-id=\"image://c4c00d536d51f8b2fbba2051f94ab094\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Andreas speaks with Til, the shepherd interested in old legends.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"c4c00d536d51f8b2fbba2051f94ab094\" data-recommend-id=\"image://c4c00d536d51f8b2fbba2051f94ab094\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Andreas speaks with Til, the shepherd interested in old legends.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><blockquote data-type=\"BlockQuote\" class=\"sc-8hxd3p-0 cfcqyq\"><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">“[Til] works in the field. And he looks at the Roman ruins all the time. He’s a shepherd. And he’s like ‘I love books and I love the stories about the Romans’ and I think it comes across that this is something that he really cares about and is interested in. When Andreas sees the figure jump across the aqueduct, [that’s why Kreutzer says] ‘oh yeah, who knows how many Roman [spirits] are here.’”</p></blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The scene Sawyer refers to is one where the protagonist, Andreas, spies what is assumed to be a ghost near the Roman ruins (though it’s not entirely clear what it is). Til is a natural fit to provide the context and add to the spookiness of the scene, thanks to his learned knowledge and proximity to the ruins themselves. This scene, and previous conversations with Til, paint a portrait of a living history within Tassing. That history is both seen and unseen, in the ruins and stories people tell. It’s what makes the sighting of the apparition all the more spooky, even though there doesn’t appear to be anything supernatural going on in the game whatsoever. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Had Til just been a bog standard NPC who delivered lines of dialogue about ruins, and not something with a personal interest and a bit of a backstory as to how he developed that interest, this scene wouldn’t land with the same weight.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 cvXwRv\">\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">A recurring theme in <em>Pentiment</em> is the history of paganism in the region. While the town is thoroughly Christianized and many characters embrace that faith, old beliefs and customs are not easily forgotten. As you’re unfolding more and more of <em>Pentiment</em>’s story, you get a greater sense of the path that lies between different historical eras, and how that feeds into the daily lives of these people. For this, Sawyer described Ill Peter as an effective conduit for an understanding of how things were before the church.</p>\n<blockquote data-type=\"BlockQuote\" class=\"sc-8hxd3p-0 cfcqyq\"><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">“Ill Peter is one of the repositories of pagan knowledge within the community and he resents that the new abbot doesn’t really respect their traditions. So this is something that’s important to him. He believes it’s important to continue practicing [older traditions] and he kind of resents the abbot and is a little sour that young people don’t remember these old ways.”</p></blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Pentiment</em>’s characters aren’t merely delivering “abstract” history lessons, Sawyer says, and that’s what makes them work so well as the primary story movers. The individual interests of each character impact your work as you investigate potential motives and unpack the sticky intersectional fabric that might have led to the murder in question. Everything is inherently tied up in historical and political connections. Chatting with just about any character is an opportunity for the game to show off the historical research that went into its development, while also providing various hints about other characters, giving Andreas what he needs to piece the murder mystery together. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But none of that would resonate, whether it’s fictional or not, if these characters didn’t have personal investments in what they’re talking about or didn’t feel like real people. Sawyer’s extensive work to establish them as believable figures is what makes <em>Pentiment</em>’s characters so fascinating.<br></p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"0e55695cc431a86bdc932164e91bb3b9\" data-recommend-id=\"image://0e55695cc431a86bdc932164e91bb3b9\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Illuminata talks of old tales and books.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"0e55695cc431a86bdc932164e91bb3b9\" data-recommend-id=\"image://0e55695cc431a86bdc932164e91bb3b9\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Illuminata talks of old tales and books.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">More than anything else in <em>Pentiment</em>, I enjoyed my time with these characters, learning about their lives, and sharing meals with them. What they have to say about the world, both the broader one that exists outside of the bounds of Tassing and their daily lives as well, is what pulled me into the murder mystery. No one felt like a generic NPC townsperson tasked with walking around in circles delivering history lessons. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">“These are all stories that are important to these individual people” Sawyer said, “and I try to make sure that the writers communicate the connection of the story to the person, not just the story itself. Because if you don’t communicate both, it’s gonna not feel good.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Pentiment</em> is a unique game. One that may not be for everyone. But in 2022, it stands as a stellar example of how intentional decisions over who tells what story satisfies the utility of teaching the player about the world while also presenting characters who have an investment in the world around them. That effect is contagious, leading to you the player in turn caring about the world of the game and the time you spend in it.</p>', '2024-03-11 11:35:52', '2024-03-11 11:35:52', 'Fallout: New Vegas Director On Creating Some Of 2022\'s Best Video Game Characters', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/2758442fcbc7c9e3bb0ef09dd98c80bb.jpg', 'year-in-review', 'https://kotaku.com/pentiment-obsidian-josh-sawyer-interview-xbox-gamepass-1849932260', '2022 brought us a number of rich narratives in games.

I didn’t love it. I’ll certainly remember it, though, in all its frustrating rigidity, and it’s one of the few games I played to completion this year, so it earns a spot on this list, if not a number. <em>God of War Ragnarök </em>is a game in which the main character, ostensibly a god, is frequently unable to leap across tiny gaps to smash the chest or reach the path on the other side because the true gods here, the game designers whose heavy hand you feel at every turn, say he has to do it the intended way. It’s an endlessly limiting game, with Kratos as trapped as Pac-Man in his maze. It’s a game in which characters are constantly wondering and worrying about whether their fates are dictated by prophecy, which is ironic given that the game itself is <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://bulletpointsmonthly.com/2022/12/21/god-is-dead-but-god-is-still-dad-god-of-war-ragnarok\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://bulletpointsmonthly.com/2022/12/21/god-is-dead-but-god-is-still-dad-god-of-war-ragnarok\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">so trapped by formula and expectation</a></span>.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Ragnarök</em> seems to want to deepen Kratos as a character, to question all the unbridled rage and quick-time-event sex-minigame misogyny of the original <em>God of War </em>games, but it can’t actually shatter the chains that bind it, because then, what would it be? What would it be if Kratos didn’t have<em> </em>to be an angry killing machine? What if he could actually show more emotional growth and expression than a tiny, late-game bit of tenderness, which only feels significant because we’re so used to seeing him express no tenderness at all? What if he could cast off patriarchy altogether and find a new way forward?<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Sadly, we may never know, as the marketplace still seems to set strict limits on just what a “AAA,” prestige release can be. The one thing I really appreciate about <em>Ragnarök </em>is how, in the end, one character is left truly broken by grief, and the game doesn’t try to bring it to a tidy resolution. There’s nothing anyone can say to fix it, to solve it, to make it go away. It felt like a kernel of surprising emotional honesty in a game that is mostly just going through the motions of being what fate dictates it must be.</p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h565303\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>Honorable Mention: <em>Vampire Survivors</em>\n</h2>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"f43a92d58bcfbe70da3ab4592e91ba8a\" data-recommend-id=\"image://f43a92d58bcfbe70da3ab4592e91ba8a\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"800\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A figure stands surrounded by ghoulish enemies while blue beams radiate out from them and red damage numbers rise from some of the enemies.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"f43a92d58bcfbe70da3ab4592e91ba8a\" data-recommend-id=\"image://f43a92d58bcfbe70da3ab4592e91ba8a\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"800\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A figure stands surrounded by ghoulish enemies while blue beams radiate out from them and red damage numbers rise from some of the enemies.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Here’s one that didn’t quite make the list but that I fully appreciated, without qualm or reservation. I’m normally very suspicious of games that seem focused on letting you become a ludicrously powerful figure who can wipe out enemies by the hundreds. <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, however, is just so gleefully unapologetic about it, fully embracing its nature as a video-game-ass video game, that it won me over. There’s a real sense of joy and discovery here as you pursue powerful new weapon fusions which let you harvest your unending legions of <em>Castlevania</em>-inspired foes even more effectively and in even more dazzling ways. On a really good run, the screen can get filled with so much 8-bit weaponry and pixelated carnage that it all starts to look like a psychedelic kaleidoscope of holy vengeance.

The four central characters continue to navigate things like crushing parental expectations, confusing thoughts about gender, and romantic yearning for other girls in scenes that are by turns hilarious and heartbreaking.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s not just the subject matter or the great sense of humor that makes <em>Butterfly Soup 2 </em>remarkable, though; it’s that Lei reveals to us the rich and complicated inner lives of her characters—their hopes, their insecurities, their fears—in ways that feel organic, honest, and compassionate. In video games, the explorations of character that get the most attention and praise are often those that accompany big-budget mainstream action. In my opinion, though, there’s more heart and more <!-- -->insight into the human condition in this two-hour game about queer Asian high-school girls than there is in most post-apocalyptic blockbusters or games about violent dads trying to be better.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/butterfly-soup-2-brianna-lei-queer-game-visual-novel-1849756898\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/butterfly-soup-2-brianna-lei-queer-game-visual-novel-1849756898\">Don’t Miss One Of The Most Heartfelt (And Funniest) Games Of 2022</a></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h565306\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><em>Return to Monkey Island</em>\n</h2>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"a82f5f53ec7c6069a7bede7b3eddd7a9\" data-recommend-id=\"image://a82f5f53ec7c6069a7bede7b3eddd7a9\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Guybrush Threepwood, mighty pirate, stands before three piratey figures in a dimly lit room.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"a82f5f53ec7c6069a7bede7b3eddd7a9\" data-recommend-id=\"image://a82f5f53ec7c6069a7bede7b3eddd7a9\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Guybrush Threepwood, mighty pirate, stands before three piratey figures in a dimly lit room.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I was both excited about and wary of <em>Return to Monkey Island</em>, series creator Ron Gilbert’s return to the helm of the comedic pirate adventure saga. The last entry he oversaw was 1991’s <em>Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge</em>, which has one of the all-time great video game endings—one so good, in fact, that for a long time I swore off later games in the series, as they both lacked Gilbert’s guiding hand and flew in the face of <em>2</em>’s conclusion. Could even he, I wondered, make a game worthy of following up such a boldly uncompromising moment?<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But here’s the thing. I’m a teensy bit older now than I was when <em>Monkey Island 2 </em>came out. I’m less wowed by raw artistic boldness and more moved by human frailty, kindness, and honesty. Ron Gilbert is older, too, and you feel a gentle reckoning with that in this game, as Guybrush goes on a kind of existential quest, one of those “what does it all mean” things that calls into question what his whole life as a pirate has really even been about. <em>Return to Monkey Island </em>is suffused with tenderness, above all. Sure, it’s still funny, and Guybrush is as irresistibly likable as ever, but there’s a poignant quality to him and the game itself this time around, an acceptance that things change and that life doesn’t quite play out the way you think it will. There’s beauty in that, too. <em>Return to Monkey Island </em>is just lovely.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h565307\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><em>Elden Ring</em>\n</h2>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"af4f19f06b79f012906b40ca7468e7c3\" data-recommend-id=\"image://af4f19f06b79f012906b40ca7468e7c3\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2552\" data-height=\"1432\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A figure in armor on horseback faces a colossal golden tree.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"af4f19f06b79f012906b40ca7468e7c3\" data-recommend-id=\"image://af4f19f06b79f012906b40ca7468e7c3\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2552\" data-height=\"1432\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A figure in armor on horseback faces a colossal golden tree.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">When I first played <em>Dark Souls</em>, I felt like something in my brain was being rewired as I discovered all the intricate ways its interlocking, shortcut-filled world turned in on itself. And like many others, I found a kind of therapeutic catharsis in throwing myself against its grueling gauntlet, facing defeat again and again and again until finally, bruised and bloody, I stood victorious. It became a way of facing internal demons of doubt and fear, of enduring the world’s transphobic slings and arrows and remaining unbowed.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Elden Ring </em>couldn’t quite match those glorious heights for me, though I appreciate that its open-world format, which makes its myriad challenges more approachable but no less uncompromising, meant that with this game, many got to experience those thrills for the first time. But even if it didn’t burrow into my very soul (no pun intended) the way <em>Dark Souls </em>did, the Lands Between still captivated me with their faded grandeur and their sense of true mystery—mystery of the sort that reveals, by contrast, just how embarrassingly eager so many game worlds are to force-feed you everything they have to offer.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h565308\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><em>Fortnite</em>\n</h2>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"9f10ea5cd7280564974dc7672c4b9d99\" data-recommend-id=\"image://9f10ea5cd7280564974dc7672c4b9d99\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A number of figures (including the hero of the Doom games and Geralt from The Witcher) stand facing an island\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"9f10ea5cd7280564974dc7672c4b9d99\" data-recommend-id=\"image://9f10ea5cd7280564974dc7672c4b9d99\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A number of figures (including the hero of the Doom games and Geralt from The Witcher) stand facing an island\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But alas, there was one world which captivated me even more. Epic’s battle-royale juggernaut continues to have, for my money, the best world in all of games—a world that is constantly changing, constantly evolving and slipping away; a world that, unlike most game worlds, actually exists in time and feels its passage. (It’s because the game is constantly reinventing itself that I have no qualms about including it on a 2022 list.)<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Over the course of the game’s seasons and chapters, the world shifts in ways big and small, always in flux where so many worlds feel stagnant. Locations that come to feel as familiar to you as an old hoodie sooner or later fade, and when they’re gone, you can never, ever go back. As the world evolves, so too does the game, which is in a state of constant change—and loss. New gameplay mechanics, too, come and go with the seasons, not because the game is striving for some kind of ultimate, perfect “optimization” of mechanics and balance, but simply because things change.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The ever-evolving island is the perfect setting for this game of wild, <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"http://tevisthompson.com/its-not-coming-back/\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"http://tevisthompson.com/its-not-coming-back/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">radical contingency</a></span>, a game in which the actions of players ping-pong off of each other in ways so complicated by chance and choice that there’s no room for the <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\"[]\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Toxic-Meritocracy-Video-Games-Culture/dp/1517900417?asc_campaign=kinjalink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/best-games-2022-elden-ring-vampire-survivors-fortnite-1849927777&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjalink-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\" data-amazonasin=\"1517900417\" data-amazontag=\"kinjalink-20\">bullshit “meritocracy” mindset</a></span> that poisons so much of gaming culture. Sure, some people are much better at the game than others, but with 99 players running around, their encounters influenced by so many factors, <em>Fortnite </em>is at least as much a big chaos-theory playground as it is a test of skill. Each match is home to a dozen or more stories that unfolded just so and will never, ever happen quite that way again. And as you make your way across the island, you see the evidence of them—a pile of goodies marking a player’s death near a few hastily tossed-up walls; a smoking semi-truck half-submerged in a river; a confrontation happening in the distance with players ping-ponging across the landscape, using this season’s shockwave hammers to fling themselves wildly into the air and then come crashing down on their opponents.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Of course, <em>Fortnite </em>constantly breaks my heart, too. In what I can only assume is an effort by Epic to make it so that all of the game’s human players win, on average, somewhat more than one out of every hundred games, it’s flooded the island with bots, beginning with the start of the game’s second chapter in October of 2019. They may seem like human players of rudimentary skill to those players who weren’t around back in the game’s pre-bot days, but their presence and simplistic behavior saps the game of much of its dynamism. I’d much rather have every confrontation be with a human adversary whose desire to survive and to win I can feel coming through in their actions, even if it means I rarely score a victory royale myself, than frequently encounter these non-human opponents who practically offer themselves up to my crosshairs.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But what can I do? The kind of life, vibrancy, comedy and tragedy that <em>Fortnite </em>offers remains unique in my experience in the gaming landscape, so I’ll keep leaping onto the island, always eager to see what signs of life and change I might stumble upon this time.</p>', '2024-03-11 11:35:52', '2024-03-11 11:35:52', 'Carolyn Petit’s Top 5 Games Of 2022', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/38e5f68191528e41f62347463592ce9b.jpg', 'year-in-review', 'https://kotaku.com/best-games-2022-elden-ring-vampire-survivors-fortnite-1849927777', 'In recent years, it’s become harder and harder for me to make the kinds of in-de...', ''),

Many of us who could never latch onto a FromSoft game willingly clung to <em>Elden Ring</em>’s teat, as we learned we could, in fact, get on a horse and fuck off away from some horrifying eldritch beast.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">As we collectively made our way through <em>Elden Ring</em>, we were given the gift that comes only with truly open-world games: seemingly endless discoveries by ourselves, our friends, and other players on the internet. </p>\n\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 cvXwRv\">\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h583674\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Braving Brutal Battles For A Glimpse Of Beauty</strong>\n</h2>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"20a911687590e0dfce235fa8fbe78b47\" data-recommend-id=\"image://20a911687590e0dfce235fa8fbe78b47\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Elden Ring\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"20a911687590e0dfce235fa8fbe78b47\" data-recommend-id=\"image://20a911687590e0dfce235fa8fbe78b47\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Elden Ring\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The beauty of <em>Elden Ring</em> lies in its world that teems, bubbles, and spews with both friendly and deadly life, that tantalizes and terrifies with its landscapes, that beckons and shuns you in a single breath. I find this beauty in so many moments during my time with the game, like when I accidentally descend down to the <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-worst-enemies-ancestral-followers-siofra-riv-1848835538\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-worst-enemies-ancestral-followers-siofra-riv-1848835538\">Siofra River</a></span>, not too long into my playthrough.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In Limgrave, I step on a platform and am whisked down, down, down, until I emerge into an astounding space: a fully realized night sky in a variety of bruise colors, littered with pinholes of light. Crumbling classical architecture obfuscates my view of this impossible galaxy and tombstones line the path leading away from the platform, which glowed a bizarre green during my descent but now lies dormant.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I am, as the kids say, gagged, and stumble aimlessly away from the platform, paying little attention to what enemies may lie in my path for the first time since booting up <em>Elden Ring</em>. This is a mistake I quickly pay for, as I walk directly into a horde of Claymen. They move slowly, but they hurt, and I am severely underleveled for this area. One of the weaponless magic conjurers takes me out in seconds with his weird bubbles, sending me back to the Site of Grace right next to the platform that brought me here. When I go back to fetch my several hundred runes, the same guy takes me out again.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">“Fuck that,” I mumble before stepping on the stone circle at the center of the lift. “I’ll come back later.” </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">And I do, just much, much later. After I’ve discovered I’m a battle mage with an affinity for gravity magic and summons, and long after I fell the Tree Sentinel with a single Rock Sling, I return to the Siofra River from a completely different direction, and lay waste to its inhabitants. Then, after I’ve collected every last item dropped by a fallen NPC and picked all the Ghost Glovewort my eyes can see, I allow myself a second to breathe. I glance up at that still-impossible night sky, and exhale. I earned this. <em>Elden Ring</em>, unlike other FromSoftware games, gave me ample chances to amass the tools and experience I’d need to earn a brief respite. <br></p>\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 cvXwRv\">\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h583675\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>Elden Ring Eternal</h2>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" id=\"\" data-id=\"c0a3149fe57ec2d7b968772e323019d9\" data-recommend-id=\"image://c0a3149fe57ec2d7b968772e323019d9\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Elden Ring Frenzied Flame ending\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"c0a3149fe57ec2d7b968772e323019d9\" data-recommend-id=\"image://c0a3149fe57ec2d7b968772e323019d9\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Elden Ring Frenzied Flame ending\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But <em>Elden Ring </em>isn’t just somber and serious, it’s not just hours of grueling gameplay with brief, meditative breaks.

But before we get to the games, I want to say a few words about the list, and why we present it the way we do, unranked, in alphabetical order.<br></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Kotaku</em>, like any site, is a collection of individuals, each with our own voices, tastes, and perspectives. Though we do our best to arrive at a list that reflects what we as a site collectively feel are the best games of the past year, well, the truth is that games, like any art form or medium, are subjective, and no list of 12 can actually capture the complexity of our overlapping and diverging opinions. While most of us love most of these games, not all of us love all of them, and there are a few games some of us strongly feel should be here that aren’t. That’s just the way it goes. Some difficult choices were made. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">To pick a single game of the year would reduce that complexity even further, particularly in a year like this one, in which so many games excelled in so many different ways that measuring them against each other seems to perhaps miss the point. How can you really evaluate <em>Unpacking </em>against <em>Halo Infinite</em>? This list allows us to present both games, as different as they are, as among the year’s very best, emblematic of the wonderful variety of ways in which games can entertain us and offer us meaningful experiences. We get to put the micro-budget and the AAA on equal footing, acknowledging that the landscape of games would be significantly diminished if any of them were missing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Part of what I love about reading great games criticism is getting to see the range of perspectives out there, reading an argument  celebrating a game I dislike, or arguing against one I admire. This list lacks our individual voices but thankfully, to get the fuller picture of our individual tastes, you can (and should) read <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/aris-top-ten-games-of-2021-1848278506\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/aris-top-ten-games-of-2021-1848278506\">Ari’s</a></span>, <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/fahey-s-top-ten-games-of-2021-1848252555\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/fahey-s-top-ten-games-of-2021-1848252555\">Fahey’s</a></span>, <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/ian-walkers-top-ten-games-of-2021-1848259755\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/ian-walkers-top-ten-games-of-2021-1848259755\">Ian’s</a></span>, <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/jeremy-winslows-top-10-games-of-2021-1848287922\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/jeremy-winslows-top-10-games-of-2021-1848287922\">Jeremy’s</a></span>, <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/john-walkers-top-10-games-of-2021-1848258549\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/john-walkers-top-10-games-of-2021-1848258549\">John’s</a></span>, <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/luke-plunketts-top-10-games-of-2021-1848231602\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/luke-plunketts-top-10-games-of-2021-1848231602\">Luke’s</a></span>, <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/renata-price-s-top-ten-games-of-2021-1848266260\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/renata-price-s-top-ten-games-of-2021-1848266260\">Renata’s</a></span>, <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/sisi-jiang-s-top-ten-games-of-2021-1848283089?rev=1641324898002\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/sisi-jiang-s-top-ten-games-of-2021-1848283089?rev=1641324898002\">Sisi’s</a></span>, and <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/zack-zwiezens-top-10-games-of-2021-1848267109\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/zack-zwiezens-top-10-games-of-2021-1848267109\">Zack’s</a></span> personal lists.

However, a few months after the game\'s June release during The Game Awards 2023, Square Enix revealed FFXVI would be getting two DLCs. </p>\n\n<p>The first – Echoes of the Fallen – was a combat-centric DLC released that same night. The second – The Rising Tide – is a more expansive, story-focused DLC about the Leviathan Eikon curiously missing from the main game.

He was 68.</p>\n\n<p>The news was broken early this morning in a public letter by Toriyama\'s manga studio, Bird Studio. Bird revealed in a letter posted on the official Dragon Ball X account that Toriyama died on March 1 of acute subdural hematoma. A private funeral service was held, and the studio has asked fans to respect the privacy of Toriyama\'s family. You can read the full letter below.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\nDear Friends \n\nWe are deeply saddened to inform you that Manga creator Akira Toriyama passed away on March 1st due to subdural hematoma. He was in age of 68.\n\nIt\'s our deep regret that he still had several works in the middle of creation with great enthusiasm. Also, he would have many more things to achieve.\n\nHowever, he has left many manga titles and works of art to this world. Thanks to the support of so many people around the world, he has been able to continues his creative activities for over 45 years. We hope that Akira Toriyama\'s unique world of creation continues to be loved by everyone for a long time to come.\n\nWe inform you this sad news, with gratefulness for your kindness during his lifetime.\n\nFuneral service was held with his family and very few relatives. Following his wishes for tranquility, we respectfully inform you that we would not accept flowers, condolences gifts, visiting, offerings and others. Also, we ask you to refrain from conducting interviews with his family.\n\nFuture plan for commemorate gathering is not decided, we will let you know when it\'s confirmed.We deeply thank you for your understanding and support as always.\n\n<p>Akira Toriyama was born in 1955 and became a manga artist at 23. Primarily known for his works in <em>Weekly Shōnen Jump</em> for works such as Dr. Slump, his biggest claim to fame would be Dragon Ball. First published in 1983, Dragon Ball would explode into a cultural phenomenon, spawning a massively popular multimedia franchise with multiple manga volumes, a successful long-running anime, several films, and a litany of merchandise.

Olympian legends like the god of the underworld, <strong>Hades</strong>, and the god of thunder, <strong>Zeus</strong>, now rule the island with rage. </p>\n\n<p>You can get a glimpse of Hades, Zeus, and other battle pass skins, including <strong>Korra</strong> from <em>The Legend of Korra </em>animated series, in the image below: </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/07/82e0529d/c5s2_battle_pass_lineup_en.jpg\" alt=\"fortnite chapter 5 season 2 myths &amp; mortals battle pass lineup skins changes greek mythology\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" class=\"image-style-body-default\">\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3>New Locations</h3>\n\n<p>At <strong>Mount Olympus</strong>, the home of Zeus, you\'ll always feel like you\'re being watched by the massive Zeus monument that graces this mountain POI, according to Epic Games. </p>\n\n \n\n<p>To get to the Underworld, players will need to cross the river at <strong>Grim Gate</strong>, where the three-headed <strong>Cerberus</strong> guard dog awaits. Venture to the west of the island to confront this legendary foe. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The Underworld</strong> is the home of Hades. Despite its flowing streams, Epic Games says the land of this city is almost completely dried up. </p>\n\n \n\n<p>Another location is the <strong>Brawler\'s Battleground</strong> arena, south of Mount Olympus. It\'s where Ares always welcomes an admirable foe – and speaking of <strong>Ares, this god is the Outfit of the April 2024 Crew Pack</strong>. </p>\n\n<h3><strong>New Weapons</strong></h3>\n\n<p>The new <strong>Thunderbolt of Zeus</strong> allows players to rise into the air and hurl lightning bolts at enemies below.

Find regular versions across the island or the Mythic version from defeating Hades.\" It\'s the weapon Zeus is holding in the image at the top of this story. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The Huntress DMR </strong>is a new rifle from Artemis, the goddess of the moonlit hunt. It\'s apparently great against the gods on the island, Epic Games says.

However, the latest update nerfed the railgun so that it can\'t penetrate heavy armor when in Safe mode, which protects the user from overcharging the weapon and blowing themselves up. Unsafe mode can still blast right through armor, but it brings with it that lethal risk. Both in Safe and Unsafe modes, the railgun\'s damage against durable enemy parts has been decreased.</p>\n<p>In response to a fan demanding the railgun be \"fixed,\" Pilestedt said simply, \"We did,\" adding a \'melting face\' emoji and following up with this clarification:</p>\n\n\n<p>\"But 4 real though, the rail gun in unsafe mode didn\'t change the capabilities of it as it should.

But once I asked myself if I had really conveyed that part of their relationship, I found that I wasn\'t too confident. Not only were there not enough specific scenes to convey this, but there also wasn&#8217;t enough dialogue that hinted at their friendship. I regretted this for a long time.\"</p>\n\n<p>When the Remake project kicked off, Nojima says he set a goal \"to properly portray Aerith and Tifa&#8217;s friendship.\" This ultimately bled into the relationships between other characters, with \"connectedness\" becoming a unifying theme for his approach and the story as a whole. \"It&#8217;s because of this connectedness that the characters and the planet on which they live were born,\" Nojima says.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>\"Thank you to that programmer from all those years ago,\" he concludes. I suppose we can also thank this programmer for, in part, indirectly inspiring the endearing relationships that truly blossom in Rebirth, with Tifa and Aerith quickly becoming fan favorites all over again.&#160;</p>\n<p>Nojima\'s had an interesting history with Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Rebirth. Last November, he <u>asked fans to stop sending him messages demanding he kill off</u> or cut out their least-favorite characters. A month later, as Nojima shared his frustrations with the targeted harassment he\'d inexplicably received, <u>fans organized a wholesome thank-you movement</u> to highlight their love of all things FF7.&#160;</p>\n<p>Just a few weeks ago, Rebirth co-director Naoki Hamaguchi said he\'s<u> begun been working with Nojima and other lead devs on the framework for Part 3</u>.

So the story goes, lucky players can sometimes encounter dog-like foes named \"Test 0\" if they descend down the well found at the start of Corel Prison.

(230, NULL, '<p>An Enshrouded player tackled the survival game in the most chaotic way possible, and its developer promptly asked them to \"break our game some more.\"&#160;</p>\n\n<p>Streamer Let\'s Game It Out aka Josh, who is known for pushing games to their limits, has given Enshrouded a try and basically manipulated it enough to skip over big chunks of the game. Instead of playing how the developer generally wants you to, this streamer acts on impulse throughout the entire playthrough.</p>\n<p>You can watch the full playthrough below, but I\'m going to highlight some of the best parts. Straight out of the gate, Josh was not prepared to follow the path that developer Keen Games had laid out for. Rather than follow the path towards the cave like he was supposed to, Josh instead thought it would be more fun to try and scale down the cliff below without taking any fall damage - which took more than a few tries.&#160;</p>\n\n\n<p>After this, Josh gets around by basically punching everything his character comes into contact with, including wagons and a lit campfire. This is also when the streamer chooses violence and, instead of exiting The Shroud, decides to stick it out to see what\'ll happen. In case you\'re new to Enshrouded, the answer is death. Death will happen.&#160;</p>\n\n<iframe data-lazy-priority=\"high\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hR9hJ3tQals\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>After encountering (or just running away from) a few enemies, Josh finally decides to set up base. &#160;This is when things get real interesting. Instead of placing a normal base in a normal place, our hero reckons it\'d be better to dig a huge hole several feet deep into the ground and set up camp here. Once he\'s gathered materials to make things in the base, it\'s then a case of a lot of trial and error. For some reason, Josh thinks it\'s a good idea to get a few workbenches in the base, and by a few, I mean a lot.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>The chaos continues for a little while longer as the streamer keeps NPCs in cages, builds a ridiculous amount of bridges and stairs so he can get around quicker, takes out a boss from underneath by digging a tunnel, punches a door for 45 minutes until it breaks so he can get inside, and so much more. He gets through a lot of the game in a short amount of time.&#160;</p>\n<p>The best part of this playthrough is that Keen Games responded to it not once, but twice. In the comments of the YouTube video, the developer writes: \"We\'ve been expecting Let\'s Game It Out nonsense for a while and we burst out laughing when we saw the desk graveyard anyway. We\'re not biased at all when we say you should break our game some more.\"&#160;</p>\n<p>Over on Twitter, the developer also <u>retweeted</u> Josh\'s post promoting the video and added: \"We\'re calling the police and you will answer for your many crimes.\" Which is about the best response you could hope for after breaking a game right in front of its creator.&#160;</p>\n<p><em>Find out what else is worth a try with our </em><u><em>best survival games</em></u><em> guide.&#160;</em></p>', '2024-03-11 11:51:14', '2024-03-11 11:51:14', '\"You should break our game some more,\" Enshrouded dev tells devious player after they use exploits to skip huge chunks of the survival game', 'https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aQzSayKRZpMMVZbK6fBSJb.jpg', 'games', 'https://www.gamesradar.com/you-should-break-our-game-some-more-enshrouded-dev-tells-devious-player-after-they-use-exploits-to-skip-huge-chunks-of-the-survival-game/', 'An Enshrouded player tackled the survival game in the most chaotic way possible,...', '');

Okay, maybe they don\'t say that about crabs per se, but it\'s definitely true in the case of Another Crab\'s Treasure. Developer Aggro Crab is bringing us a new souls-like experience under the sea as a crustacean called Krill who\'s on the hunt for treasure to buy back his repurposed shell. In the polluted underwater world, trash is considered to be a valuable resource that\'s used for just about everything, but it also brings with it an infection known as the Gunk which threatens the ocean. If you\'re on the lookout for a new souls-like experience &#8211; featuring a whole lot of crabs, no less &#8211; this is one adventure to watch out for.&#160;</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-gecko-gods-xa0\">The Gecko Gods &#160;</h2>\n<figure class=\"van-image-figure inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" alt=\"The Gecko Gods\" class=\" lazy-image-van\" onerror=\"if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf(\'missing-image.svg\') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/gamesradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PWvaJr2CpyyFDhMDbVe4if-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PWvaJr2CpyyFDhMDbVe4if-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PWvaJr2CpyyFDhMDbVe4if-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PWvaJr2CpyyFDhMDbVe4if-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PWvaJr2CpyyFDhMDbVe4if-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PWvaJr2CpyyFDhMDbVe4if-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w\" data-sizes=\"(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PWvaJr2CpyyFDhMDbVe4if.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PWvaJr2CpyyFDhMDbVe4if.jpg\"></source><source type=\"image/jpeg\" alt=\"The Gecko Gods\" class=\" lazy-image-van\" onerror=\"if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf(\'missing-image.svg\') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/gamesradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PWvaJr2CpyyFDhMDbVe4if-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PWvaJr2CpyyFDhMDbVe4if-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PWvaJr2CpyyFDhMDbVe4if-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PWvaJr2CpyyFDhMDbVe4if-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PWvaJr2CpyyFDhMDbVe4if-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PWvaJr2CpyyFDhMDbVe4if-1200-80.jpg 1200w\" data-sizes=\"(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PWvaJr2CpyyFDhMDbVe4if.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PWvaJr2CpyyFDhMDbVe4if.jpg\"></source><img src=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/gamesradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" alt=\"The Gecko Gods\" class=\" lazy-image-van\" onerror=\"if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf(\'missing-image.svg\') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/gamesradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PWvaJr2CpyyFDhMDbVe4if-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PWvaJr2CpyyFDhMDbVe4if-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PWvaJr2CpyyFDhMDbVe4if-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PWvaJr2CpyyFDhMDbVe4if-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PWvaJr2CpyyFDhMDbVe4if-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PWvaJr2CpyyFDhMDbVe4if-1200-80.jpg 1200w\" data-sizes=\"(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PWvaJr2CpyyFDhMDbVe4if.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PWvaJr2CpyyFDhMDbVe4if.jpg\"></picture></p>\n<figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Super Rare Originals)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Release date:</strong> Spring 2024<br><strong>Platform(s): </strong>PC, Switch</p>\n<p>If you\'re looking for a relaxing puzzle-based experience, The Gecko Gods might just be one to add to your wishlist.

With its enchanting concept, The Plucky Squire will see us jump from 2D to 3D as the small but mighty hero Jot, who discovers the world that lies outside of the pages of his storybook home. The debut trailer certainly left a lasting impression, with Toy Story vibes and elements that bring to mind the nostalgic 2D platforming sections of Super Mario Odyssey. After leaving the storybook and emerging into the 3D world of the bedroom, we got to see how Jot can shift between dimensions by jumping onto the surfaces of different objects. It really does look like it has the makings for one creatively charming platforming adventure.</p>\n<h2 id=\"closer-the-distance\">Closer the Distance</h2>\n<figure class=\"van-image-figure inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" alt=\"Closer the Distance\" class=\" lazy-image-van\" onerror=\"if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf(\'missing-image.svg\') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/gamesradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nwVUdBBFQxw9gc4oZPv9y7-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nwVUdBBFQxw9gc4oZPv9y7-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nwVUdBBFQxw9gc4oZPv9y7-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nwVUdBBFQxw9gc4oZPv9y7-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nwVUdBBFQxw9gc4oZPv9y7-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nwVUdBBFQxw9gc4oZPv9y7-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w\" data-sizes=\"(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nwVUdBBFQxw9gc4oZPv9y7.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nwVUdBBFQxw9gc4oZPv9y7.jpg\"></source><source type=\"image/jpeg\" alt=\"Closer the Distance\" class=\" lazy-image-van\" onerror=\"if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf(\'missing-image.svg\') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/gamesradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nwVUdBBFQxw9gc4oZPv9y7-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nwVUdBBFQxw9gc4oZPv9y7-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nwVUdBBFQxw9gc4oZPv9y7-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nwVUdBBFQxw9gc4oZPv9y7-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nwVUdBBFQxw9gc4oZPv9y7-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nwVUdBBFQxw9gc4oZPv9y7-1200-80.jpg 1200w\" data-sizes=\"(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nwVUdBBFQxw9gc4oZPv9y7.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nwVUdBBFQxw9gc4oZPv9y7.jpg\"></source><img src=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/gamesradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" alt=\"Closer the Distance\" class=\" lazy-image-van\" onerror=\"if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf(\'missing-image.svg\') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/gamesradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nwVUdBBFQxw9gc4oZPv9y7-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nwVUdBBFQxw9gc4oZPv9y7-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nwVUdBBFQxw9gc4oZPv9y7-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nwVUdBBFQxw9gc4oZPv9y7-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nwVUdBBFQxw9gc4oZPv9y7-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nwVUdBBFQxw9gc4oZPv9y7-1200-80.jpg 1200w\" data-sizes=\"(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nwVUdBBFQxw9gc4oZPv9y7.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nwVUdBBFQxw9gc4oZPv9y7.jpg\"></picture></p>\n<figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Skybound Games)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Release date: </strong>TBC 2024<strong><br>\nPlatform(s): </strong>PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S</p>\n<p>Closer the Distance is a new game from Osmotic Studios that\'s described as a slice of life sim that looks set to us a unique power.

Having made a rousing speech to their companions, the player set about making their final preparations before the big end battle. This included a spot of trading with a merchant whereby a sword caught their eye.&#160;</p>\n\n\n<p>\"I saw he had a sword on his table, so I gave it a yoink, thinking I was hidden,\" Saquon explains. \"Immediately, all my allies in the room disappear, and just the flaming fist guy is left, who immediately moves to attack me. Doesn\'t even give me a chance to explain if it\'s a misunderstanding.\"</p>\n\n<p>Having killed the assailant in self-defense, the player continues towards the final task, taking out the Netherbrain. Between them and it are numerous formidable foes, including a great big dragon. About to take on the fire-breathing beast, the player suddenly realizes they\'re all alone. \"They actually abandoned me and the fate of The Realms over one little sword,\" Saquon says. \"After all we\'d been through.\"</p>\n\n<p>To the player, throwing the towel in over a single stolen piece of equipment \"seems kind of petty,\" and they\'re not the only one who has accidentally ruined their playthrough right at the end in this way. \"Happened to me too, I was left speechless,\" says DeadTemplar. \"Like, why did you even put that thing on the table if it\'s not for the taking!?\" Even worse, another player says they didn\'t see the sword in question and \"clicked it by accident.\"</p>\n<p>According to some in the comments, this increased hostility towards stealing came about after the arrival of Patch 6, which Larian rolled out last month. One player in the comments says that before the patch was implemented, they did the same thing with \"no consequences,\" as they were simply told that they had to pay for the sword when they tried to steal it. Another says that previously, when attempting to pilfer a potion, the merchant would offer to sell it to them, but following Patch 6, \"all of them aggro the moment I steal it.\"</p>\n<p>So let that be a lesson to all of us to think twice before bolstering our inventories using the five-finger discount, particularly in Baldur\'s Gate 3\'s Honour Mode, where our transgressions can\'t be undone by a simple reload.</p>\n<p><em>Our own Ali Jones, thankfully with companions in tow, managed to </em><em>beat Baldur\'s Gate 3\'s final gauntlet with a whole new fighting style and a healthy dose of RNG</em><em>.</em></p>', '2024-03-11 11:51:14', '2024-03-11 11:51:14', 'Baldur\'s Gate 3 Monk \"that practices the Way of the Sticky Hand\" forced to do the final fight alone after angering most of the RPG\'s cast by stealing one sword', 'https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mNKVrHQwhXzF4FRpfRGLQg.jpg', 'games', 'https://www.gamesradar.com/baldurs-gate-3-monk-that-practices-the-way-of-the-sticky-hand-forced-to-do-the-final-fight-alone-after-angering-most-of-the-rpgs-cast-by-stealing-one-sword/', 'A Baldur\'s Gate 3 player who, by their own admission, role-plays \"a klepto monk ...', ''),

Ubisoft is effectively building an interactive hub that will function like the Animus, allowing you to jump between different historical playgrounds while simultaneously progressing the modern-day narrative framing that has been with the series since the beginning. The first two games to join the Infinity Hub will be Assassin\'s Creed Codename Red and Assassin\'s Creed Codename Hexe, and it is then expected to expand and evolve over time.

Originally revealed as Codename Jade before it\'s official title was confirmed at GamesCom 2023 as simply Assassin\'s Creed Jade, it will also be the first game in the series to let you create your own assassin from scratch, which is a nice touch.&#160;</p>\n<h2 id=\"assassin-apos-s-creed-netflix\">Assassin\'s Creed Netflix</h2>\n<figure class=\"van-image-figure inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" alt=\"Assassin\'s Creed Netflix\" class=\" lazy-image-van\" onerror=\"if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf(\'missing-image.svg\') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/gamesradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pkoEWdqioJ2cSMSD8vzSAg-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pkoEWdqioJ2cSMSD8vzSAg-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pkoEWdqioJ2cSMSD8vzSAg-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pkoEWdqioJ2cSMSD8vzSAg-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pkoEWdqioJ2cSMSD8vzSAg-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pkoEWdqioJ2cSMSD8vzSAg-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w\" data-sizes=\"(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pkoEWdqioJ2cSMSD8vzSAg.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pkoEWdqioJ2cSMSD8vzSAg.jpg\"></source><source type=\"image/jpeg\" alt=\"Assassin\'s Creed Netflix\" class=\" lazy-image-van\" onerror=\"if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf(\'missing-image.svg\') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/gamesradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pkoEWdqioJ2cSMSD8vzSAg-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pkoEWdqioJ2cSMSD8vzSAg-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pkoEWdqioJ2cSMSD8vzSAg-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pkoEWdqioJ2cSMSD8vzSAg-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pkoEWdqioJ2cSMSD8vzSAg-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pkoEWdqioJ2cSMSD8vzSAg-1200-80.jpg 1200w\" data-sizes=\"(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pkoEWdqioJ2cSMSD8vzSAg.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pkoEWdqioJ2cSMSD8vzSAg.jpg\"></source><img src=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/gamesradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" alt=\"Assassin\'s Creed Netflix\" class=\" lazy-image-van\" onerror=\"if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf(\'missing-image.svg\') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)\" data-normal=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/gamesradar/media/img/missing-image.svg\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pkoEWdqioJ2cSMSD8vzSAg-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pkoEWdqioJ2cSMSD8vzSAg-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pkoEWdqioJ2cSMSD8vzSAg-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pkoEWdqioJ2cSMSD8vzSAg-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pkoEWdqioJ2cSMSD8vzSAg-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pkoEWdqioJ2cSMSD8vzSAg-1200-80.jpg 1200w\" data-sizes=\"(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pkoEWdqioJ2cSMSD8vzSAg.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pkoEWdqioJ2cSMSD8vzSAg.jpg\"></picture></p>\n<figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Ubisoft)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Ubisoft&#160;<br><strong>Platform(s):</strong> Android, iOS<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> TBC</p>\n<p>Ubisoft and Netflix have entered a pretty broad collaboration agreement.

(235, NULL, '<p>The Overwatch 2 team is tweaking \"roughly half\" of the playable heroes in the upcoming midseason patch.</p>\n\n<p>Blizzard recently gave every Damage hero a new passive that allows them to reduce foes\' healing by 20% for two seconds&#8212;when you consider that they also got a self-healing passive lately alongside tanks, they aren\'t doing bad. For a competitive shooter all about team synergy and party composition, that\'s a pretty seismic shift, so the team is now making roster adjustments in an attempt to reach that unattainable \'balance.\'</p>\n<p>In a recent blog post, director Aaron Keller said the new passive aimed to push \"heroes to the forefront of a fight\" and net Damage heroes more eliminations. Both goals have been a success, but Keller admits that it might have been \"pushed a bit too far.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>To accommodate such a drastic change, the team is \"touching roughly half the heroes in the roster\" to \"make sure that all heroes feel viable.\" For example, medic sniper Ana will have her grenade\'s damage and healing buffed from 60 to 90 to \"give her more self-survivability.\" Lifeweaver is also getting a healing boost, with his maximum heal increasing from 70 to 90. Tanks Doomfist and Mauga will also enjoy damage buffs, meanwhile, Wrecking Ball needs to wait until Season 10 before he sees a small rework.</p>\n\n<p>Overwatch 2 Season 9\'s midseason update is due on March 12 with changes big and small hitting the shooter.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>Elsewhere in the world of chirpy heroes and thumb-twirling villains, Overwatch 2\'s esports scene is returning in a much different manner than we\'re used to. Microsoft\'s gaming division also laid off almost 2,000 employees, which sadly affected the Overwatch 2 team.&#160;</p>\n<p><em>One former Overwatch 2 developer explained the shooter\'s jankiness: \"The script looks like every subway map in the world layered over each other.\"</em></p>', '2024-03-11 11:51:14', '2024-03-11 11:51:14', '\"Roughly half\" of the Overwatch 2 roster is getting changes as director admits anti-healing Damage passive \"may be pushed a bit too far\"', 'https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LbSvjkkQnyRZGb2HnsoDoL.jpg', 'games', 'https://www.gamesradar.com/roughly-half-of-the-overwatch-2-roster-is-getting-changes-as-director-admits-self-healing-damage-passive-may-be-pushed-a-bit-too-far/', 'The Overwatch 2 team is tweaking \"roughly half\" of the playable heroes in the up...', ''),

There\'s a huge variety to choose from, ranging from orbital strikes courtesy of your overhead destroyer to support drops of automated weapons turrets or defensive tools, all of which can turn the tide. Carefully choosing which stratagems to equip as a team, and when to deploy them, is the crux of the game\'s most tactical considerations. While you\'ll only have access to a scant few stratagems at the start, there are dozens to eventually unlock, purchased with a rapidly accrued in-game currency that helps make each mission feel like a step forwards.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Rather brilliantly though, these stratagems cant be activated at will, instead requiring you to successfully input a series of commands on the controller\'s D-pad, in real time, typically while you\'re under heavy assault from enemies. It\'s nother way Arrowhead keeps players on their toes, constantly having to react to the environment around them. Awareness is key here, too  while there\'s no PVP, friendly fire is in effect, and it\'s all too easy to run into an ally\'s line of fire while trying to dodge whichever monstrosity is bearing down on you.

The multiplayer nature also means a PS+ subscription is mandatory for PS5 play, while the PC version comes with the controversial anti-cheat software nProtect GameGuard which, at time of writing, has reportedly caused problems with legitimate software such as game capture tools, and prevents<em>Helldivers II</em>from running on Steam Deck at all.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>The other downside to the multiplayer-only model is that, unless you\'re playing exclusively with a squad of friends, there\'s a tendency for others to head to the extraction zone and call for the escape shuttle immediately upon completion of a primary objective.

Instead of managing WW2 infantry, however, youll guide a ragtag resistance team called The Founders, former soldiers of the disbanded US military starved of resources, manpower, or even a coherent government to lead them. Legion, meanwhile, is a thriving war machine churning out all manner of metallic menaces, from classic T-800s to quadrupedal war dogs mounted with laser turrets. This immediately stacks the odds against you, lending<em>Dark Fate  Defiance</em>a uniquely survivalist streak.</p>\n</span><div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__ynq1g\" data-test=\"pullquote\">\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__icon__JGpkh\"><span></span></div>\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__content__gRuai\">\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Unfortunately, the games production value cant quite keep up with that generously proportioned scope.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>This sense of vulnerability is compounded by the fact that resources such as ammunition or vehicles are limited, and when a soldier within a unit is killed, opportunities to replenish the squad back to full force are few and far between. Your best friend in such circumstances, then, is the environment around you. Units can go prone to avoid damage, hide in grass to get the jump on enemies, or hunker down in buildings for extra defence against an unexpected onslaught.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Legions tactics, meanwhile, are anything but covert, marching straight into the heat of gunfire with all the fascist bravado youd expect from a battalion of Terminator troopers. What they lack in battle strategy, however, they make up for in terms of pure power, and the sound and sight of a fresh batch of chromatic warriors bearing down on your squadron can be a genuinely tense and terrifying affair. Outsmarting your enemy through a mix of both careful planning and on the fly improvisation, swapping ammunition and unit types to exploit enemy weaknesses, thus makes for a satisfying gameplay loop that holds potent staying power across<em>Dark Fate  Defiance</em>s lengthy campaign.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"Terminator: Dark Fate  Defiance\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2024/02/terminator-3.png?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2024/02/terminator-3.png?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2024/02/terminator-3.png?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2024/02/terminator-3.png?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2024/02/terminator-3.png?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2024/02/terminator-3.png?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2024/02/terminator-3.png?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>That campaigns mission variety is another of the games strong suits, ranging from tower defence style siege encounters to more measured, multi-quest recon adventures across sprawling open aps littered with quirky local NPCs. As far as the narrative itself goes, however, dont expect much in the way of either meaningful universe expansion or standalone storytelling. Developer Slitherines penchant for wooden dialogue remains as prevalent here as it did in<em>Stargate: Timekeepers</em>, while the games only notable contribution to<em>Terminator</em>lore here seems to be the introduction of a new human enemy faction: a guerrilla resistance group known as The Movement. Their presence seems more geared towards serving gameplay variety than story, however, allowing for opportunities to fight other humans alongside Legions mechanised warriors.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Beyond its campaign,<em>Dark Fate  Defiance</em>also features a handful of multiplayer and quick play Skirmish modes that lets players command either Founder, Legion, or Movement factions in short-burst tussles against each other or the computer. It\'s perhaps best enjoyed as an opportunity to practise and hone some of the more advanced strategies picked up from the main campaign, and though these excursions may not have the same replay value as other live service experiences, they at least serve as a nice epilogue for those still hungry after the main course of<em>Dark Fate  Defiance</em>\'s campaign.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Unfortunately, the games production value cant quite keep up with that generously proportioned scope. With the exception of its authentically realised T-800 models, the games dry visual style struggles to conjure up the same sense of palpable atmosphere as, say, the future war sequences of the<em>Terminator</em>films, with low-detail environments and achromatic colour palettes that keeps this particular future looking rather flat and dreary.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>It can sometimes give the impression of a<em>Terminator</em>story in desperate need of a budget, but that franchise window dressing ultimately isn\'t the main selling point here. Instead_, Dark Fate  Defiance_s real strengths lie in its refreshingly purist approach to the war tactics genre, with compelling combat that can hold your attention regardless of any personal affinity for the franchise itself. The track record for<em>Terminator</em>games has been about as wildly inconsistent as, well, that of its cinematic counterpart but, with its tightly designed, Terminator-infused tactical trials,<em>Dark Fate  Defiance</em>may have just helped to raise that historically low bar a little bit higher.</p>\n</span>', '2024-03-11 17:43:04', '2024-03-11 17:43:04', 'Terminator: Dark Fate  Defiance Review', 'https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2024/02/terminator-1.png?ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=top&auto=format&w=1440&q=80', 'movies', 'https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/terminator-dark-fate-defiance/', 'Platforms: PC Six films deep intoThe Terminators time-hopping saga, and we...', 'gaming'),

This cn be frustrating at times, making for even more exacting leaps between platforms, and an inability to react as swiftly to enemy movements.

This is no attempt to westernise the series though  leaning into the long history of Japanese migration to Hawaii,<em>Infinite Wealth</em>maintains the unique identity of previous games, while still allowing space to explore Kasuga in a fish-out-of-water role as he explores the darker side of paradise. Hes a real delight of a lead character, simultaneously fiercely heroic and adorably nave, and its great to see his continued development over the course of the game. And, while the game is packed with gags  an extended<em>Austin Powers</em>-esque scene where a naked Kasuga wakes up on a beach after being drugged, his modesty maintained by well-placed objects and carefully chosen camera angles, is particularly funny  its also punctuated with moments that retain an ability to shock, either with visceral violence or heartfelt drama, making for a surprisingly emotional rollercoaster.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Less developed is the games approach to combat. The returning turn-based system from<em>Yakuza: LAD</em>is lightly finessed, resulting in battles that offer a largely satisfying balance of tactics and skill. For example, its now more obvious how to position your party members to grab items around them to smack enemies with, while an improved relationship system with party members allows more varied team-up moves and combo attacks. Its also perpetually delightful to see how JRPG staples like magic and status effects are worked into the real-world setting with a knowing wink, such as new ally Tomizawa filling a mage role, delivering electric attacks by hot-wiring a car battery or a fire one by setting off flares in an opponents face.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2024/02/dragon-2.png?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2024/02/dragon-2.png?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2024/02/dragon-2.png?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2024/02/dragon-2.png?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2024/02/dragon-2.png?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2024/02/dragon-2.png?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2024/02/dragon-2.png?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Other aspects feel restrictive though, such as the Jobs system. While there are a host of different combat roles for Kasuga and his team to take on, such as Aquanaut (beating bad guys up with a surfboard), the ability to switch Jobs takes so long to be introduced that it almost feels like an afterthought. Its part of a bigger problem with pacing that has long plagued the series  even the fairly rudimentary feature of upgrading equipment doesnt come in until chapter four here, which, if youve been chasing every side story and bit of content, may be as much as 25 hours in.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Yet while the approach to combat makes it easy to pigeonhole the game as a JRPG, the real strength of the series has always been the sheer variety of play options it crams in.<em>Infinite Wealth</em>takes this to another level, with not just the usual array of minigames such as darts, arcade machines, and karaoke, but whole games-within-games.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>The deliriously strange Sujimon from<em>Yakuza: LAD</em>rturns, now evolved to a full-on<em>Pokmon</em>parody where you catalogue the assorted weirdos youve been beating up around Hawaii, then battle with them through a fighting league, aiming to be the very best. Elsewhere, Dondoko Island is essentially<em>Animal Crossing</em>, turning a trash-filled island into a five-star resort by clearing, cleaning, and crafting. Fancy a dating sim instead? Check out Miss Match, where the socially inept Kasuga tries his hand at wooing Hawaiis eligible bachelorettes through text exchanges. Theres even a_Pokmon Snap-_style minigame having you taking photos of masked perverts lurking around Hawaii, and a twist on<em>Crazy Taxi</em>where you pull off ridiculous stunts to earn tips as a bicycle courier. The sheer volume of<em>stuff</em>to do in<em>Infinite Wealth</em>is staggering, as is the quality of these side hustles  its easy to imagine some of these as their own distinct releases, and the elegance with which theyre integrated into the greater whole of<em>Infinite Wealth</em>is masterful.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Yet despite that raft of content,<em>LikeA Dragon</em>feels held back by that ever-present pacing problem.

Each of the four reluctant protagonists  Harley Quinn, King Shark, Deadshot, and Captain Boomerang  has their own distinct way of navigating the open-world environment, using tech stolen from the Justice League\'s trophy room. Early on, the game takes you through each character\'s control scheme, before asking you to choose which one you want to play as first  and it\'s not a good sign when the reaction is \"well, none of them, really\".</p>\n</span><div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__ynq1g\" data-test=\"pullquote\">\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__icon__JGpkh\"><span></span></div>\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__content__gRuai\">\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What\'s especially frustrating withSuicide Squadis that glimmers of potential are still apparent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>For instance, Harley\'s stolen Bat-grapple, allowing her to hoist herself up to ledges or swing from a Bat-drone overhead, lacks any sense of momentum.

Meanwhile, Deadshot\'s jetpack struggles with range, and Boomerang\'s short-burst teleportation  courtesy of a gauntlet hacking into Flash\'s Speed Force  lacks precision.

All of these characters have been designed to be used in tandem with one another, and pulling off the perfect plan and execution, lining up their different actions in succession and watching the harmonious team-play unfold, makes for some of<em>Timekeepers</em>\' most fulfilling moments.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Second, the game\'s litany of environments, structured across a series of linear missions, are tautly designed, and a joy to navigate, offering just enough challenge to test your tactical prowess without ever feeling unfair.<em>Stargate</em>fans will also squeeze some extra mileage out of Slitherine\'s clear affection for the franchise, with a number of nice touches adding an extra layer ofauthenticity to the experience, right down to the loading screen animation of a literal stargate dialling in coordinates to the next mission.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>There are some rough edges, to be sure. Flat textures and awkward character animations hold <em>Timekeepers</em>\' back from being easy on the eyes, and while none of its bugs are game-breaking, the sum of their parts can be enough to snap you out of its tactical flow. There\'s also the matter of structure. At present, you\'re only paying for half a game, with<em>Timekeepers</em>\' second set of episodes scheduled to release at an unspecified date later in the year. Slitherine is pitching it as the next \"Season\" of its story, but having to invest full price in only half of a product doesn\'t feel like a fair deal at present.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Even so, what\'s here is enough to make a decent first impression, and while<em>Timekeepers</em> is clearly catering to the<em>SG-1</em>uber-fans, others who can endure the baffling lack of scene-setting will discover an inspired real-time strategy campaign anchored in crunchy, squad-based subterfuge. The resulting series of playable episodes is enough to make a compelling case for bringing<em>Stargate</em>back out of its cryo-chamber.</p>\n</span>', '2024-03-11 17:43:04', '2024-03-11 17:43:04', 'Stargate: Timekeepers Review', 'https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2024/02/timekeepers-1.jpg?ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=top&auto=format&w=1440&q=80', 'movies', 'https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/stargate-timekeepers/', 'Format:PC Previously onStargate well, how long have you got?...', 'gaming'),

Although the trio of games are significantly better looking than their original handheld incarnations  especially the latter pair  there\'s still some visible pixelation and a general lack of detail that, while ignorable at smartphone resolutions and viewing distances, is readily apparent when blown up on a TV screen. The Switch release (version tested) mitigates this somewhat in handheld mode, at least.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Still, these aren\'t games people come to for GPU-stressing visuals  <em>Ace Attorney</em> has earned its stripes for fantastic characters and melodramatic court cases packed with ridiculous twists, all hinging on a meticulous attention to detail. That remains the case here and, thanks to tighter translations, the trilogy delivers three of the finest stories in the wider franchise.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>The first, taking place seven years after the previous trilogy (itself upgraded for modern consoles as <em>Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy</em> in 2019), introduces new protagonist Apollo Justice, whose very first case involves defending the former hero from a murder charge. While Apollo takes a less prominent role in the latter two games  where Phoenix regains top billing  it\'s a real delight to see the series\' expansive cast grow, change, and evolve across the trilogy.</p>\n</span><div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__ynq1g\" data-test=\"pullquote\">\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__icon__JGpkh\"><span></span></div>\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__content__gRuai\">\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When you pull apart a bogus statement and deliver a meme-worthy \"OBJECTION!\" interjection, it\'s all worth it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>However, it can\'t be avoided that these are incredibly slow games. Courtroom gameplay consists of cross-examining witnesses to each case, pressing them for more information on their testimonies, and looking for inconsistencies, with Apollo having the power to home in on a defendant\'s suspicious tics and tells, opening up new avenues to tear apart their lies. Examining evidence adds a bit more of a conventional point-and-click adventure feel at times  rotating an item to find a hidden clue, for example  but it\'s still incredibly basic stuff. While <em>Dual Destinies</em> and <em>Spirit of Justice</em> add a few new gimmicks  such as evaluating a suspect\'s emotional state  the series is never particularly mechanically challenging. Still, when you correctly pull apart a bogus statement and deliver one of the series\' meme-worthy \"OBJECTION!\" interjections, it\'s all worth it.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>A few quality-of-life improvements for the trilogy help to streamline things, too  especially on <em>Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney</em>, which now has the history feature of later games, allowing you to re-read dialogue in case you miss a crucial statement. It\'s also now possible jump into any chapter of any game, although this is only really helpful for replays  great if you already have the cases committed to memory and want to revisit a favourite moment, but not much help for newcomers who might find themselves clock-watching as they tap through endless reams of dialogue.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>The trilogy also crams in a generous helping of bonus content, which is sure to delight long-time fans. The pice de resistance is undoubtedly Orchestra Hall, a dedicated music player with a whopping 175 tracks from across the trilogy, including orchestral performances from the series\' 15th anniversary concerts, and two brand new tracks for the remaster collection. Tracks can be played non-stop, looped, or broken down by game, or you can create playlists of favourite tracks from across the suite.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>A similarly comprehensive Art Library offers up reams of character designs, in-game backgrounds, and key art visuals to pore over, while the Animation Studio takes advantage of the simple character movements in the games, allowing you to create your own compositions from a catalogue of cast, poses, and settings. Best of all, all this museum content is available from the outset, rather than being locked behind completion criteria.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Although existing fans are likely to get more from <em>Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy</em> than first-timers, it\'s a gret collection for a strangely compelling series.

For instance, there\'s an infamous puzzle in the first game that required closing the DS so a \'stamp\' on the top screen would press against the bottom screen. Another required players to blow into the handheld\'s microphone to blow dust off a long-ignored object. Such ingenious physicality drew players into the world, and Ashley\'s adventures, in a visceral way. Yet for<em>Recollection</em>, there\'s very little of that cleverness to be found  possibly stymied by the uncertainty over whether players might be playing on their TVs or in handheld mode, even puzzles that could have traded the DS touchscreen for the Switch\'s, or the Wii Remote\'s motion controls for the Joy-Cons, are drastically overhauled, usually for the worse.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Instead,<em>Recollection\'s</em>puzzles are now almost entirely solved with button prompts and the very occasional use of tilt controls that can work whether you\'re in handheld mode or using a Switch Pro controller on the TV. This wouldn\'t be so bad ifAnother Code\'s_mysteries were real head-scratchers, but these games, even in their newly combined form, are very much adventure games for beginners. Stripping out the smart use of original hardware for puzzles and doing next to nothing to adapt them for the Switch\'s own distinct capabilities leaves nothing but a glorified visual novel. This is reinforced by how grievously slow everything is to begin with, from Ashley\'s movement to camera rotation speed (trust us, nip into settings and whack that up to about 70)  it all feels simultaneously stripped back and dumbed down.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Thankfully, Ashley\'s story remains absorbing and thought-provoking, and<em>Another Code: Recollection</em>remains worth a look on that strength alone.

Characters who\'ve long stood as power players get even more unstoppable, leaving characters whose best attributes have traditionally been in speed or skill to be rapidly overwhelmed with the slightest misstep. That can become more than a little frustrating, especially if you favour a character who doesn\'t \'feel\' like a brute force fighter.</p>\n</span><div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__ynq1g\" data-test=\"pullquote\">\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__icon__JGpkh\"><span></span></div>\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__content__gRuai\">\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Tekken 8</em>may be the most feature-packed entry in the series\' history.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Perhaps to mitigate this,<em>Tekken 8</em>also introduces a simplified \'Special Style\' control scheme. While default controls retain the series\' long-standing approach of one face button controlling one limb for punches and kicks, Special Style streamlines combos and special moves to a single button press. It\'s entirely optional  fear not, purists  and can\'t hope to map the plethora of attacks a typical<em>Tekken</em>fighter has access to, but may help players as they get to grips with the new flow of the game. It\'s also great for onboarding new players, or returning ones who may need time to re-learn the game.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>While Heat incentivises aggression, it\'s also not without tactical application. While Heat is active, you gain a variety of benefits, including inflicting potentially match-deciding chip damage when your foe is blocking. Other tweaks to the fighting system, including the ability to regain health, allow some room for skill to re-emerge over raw power, and it\'ll be fascinating to see how the competitive scene evolves with the changes<em>Tekken 8</em>brings.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"Tekken 8\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2024/01/tekken-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2024/01/tekken-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2024/01/tekken-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2024/01/tekken-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2024/01/tekken-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2024/01/tekken-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2024/01/tekken-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>For solo players though, there\'s a mountain of material to keep you occupied while mastering the intricacies of the game. A hugely cinematic story mode is one of the series\' longest and most ambitious yet, bringing the inter-generational conflict between Kazuya Mishima and his son Jin Kazama to a climax. It\'s a saga packed with stunning moments, both visually  this is the first<em>Tekken</em>to use Unreal Engine 5, and looks phenomenal for it  and narratively, channelling the relentless ethos of<em>Tekken 8\'s</em>approach to combat throughout.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Beyond the Mishima family drama, every single character in the game\'s 32-strong launch roster also gets a dedicated \'episode\' detailing their background and stakes in the latest tournament. Although these are short  five fights each, with a unique finale  they do a great job of expanding the increasingly bonkers storyline. Think of it as  self-contained \'<em>Tekken</em>Cinematic Universe\', with the character-focused shorts the streaming series to the main story\'s IMAX experience.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>One of the strangest new modes for<em>Tekken 8</em>is Arcade Quest, which feels like a take on<a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/street-fighter-6/\"><em>Street Fighter 6\'s</em></a>World Tour mode. Like that, you\'ll create an avatar and travel the world to become the greatest fighter, but in an especially meta twist, here you\'re travelling between video game arcades to become the world\'s best<em>Tekken 8</em>player. While it largely serves as a glorified, extended tutorial, Arcade Quest is a solid companion mode in its own right, with a reasonably lengthy campaign to complete and plenty of avatar customisation cosmetics to unlock along the way. Unfortunately, a total departure from the game\'s visual style here  avatars and supporting characters are reminiscent of Nintendo\'s simple Mii figures  is jarring, especially when you\'re rapidly switching between the realistic<em>Tekken 8</em>battles and cartoonish arcades. Thankfully, a more conventional arcade mode is also available.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>With a return of fan-favourite mini-game<em>Tekken Ball</em> think volleyball, adapted into a contact sport  and robust online play,<em>Tekken 8</em>may be the most feature-packed entry in the series\' history. It all hinges on that new Heat system and emphasis on aggression, though, which despite broadly being a step forward, may take more getting used to than expected for returning players, while feeling a touch too unforgiving for complete newcomers.</p>\n</span>', '2024-03-11 17:43:04', '2024-03-11 17:43:04', 'Tekken 8 Review', 'https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2024/01/tekken-2.jpg?ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=top&auto=format&w=1440&q=80', 'movies', 'https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/tekken-8/', 'Platforms:PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC Tekken 8is a very angry game....', 'gaming'),

It remains a thrilling, tense, and horrifying tale, packing all the narrative twists and emotional gut-punches that made it so impactful in the first place.

Three Lost Levels give a fascinating look at the games development, offering pre-alpha builds of planned sections of the game that didnt make the final cut, playable with developers commentary. Similarly, there are a host of behind-the-scenes videos and four episodes of the official<em>The Last Of Us</em>podcast dealing with the games creation, plus a directors commentary for the game itself, that provides insight on cinematics. Another nice touch is the inclusion of a guitar free-play mode, allowing you to revel in what were quiet digressions in the main game by strumming chords for as long as you like.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Perhaps the biggest draw though will be the new No Return mode, a roguelike survival mode. This puts players through five rounds of combat against randomised enemies, while trying to complete various objectives, gathering supplies, and upgrading your character between outings. Its quite a departure from combat in the campaign, which is often frenzied and sudden, if not avoided entirely via stealth, but once youre accustomed to the different flow, its a potent reminder of how strong<em>The Last Of Us</em>combat mechanics are to begin with.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"ontent_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>If theres one part that frustrates, its that some of the bonus content, such as full game directors commentary, isnt unlocked until youve completed the story at least once. Given that for many players,<em>Part II Remastered</em>will be their second go around with the game anyway, barring this content feels slightly stingy. Though it is worth noting that saves from the original can be transferred over, allowing players to sidestep this obstacle.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>While the rapid appearance of a remastered version may still raise some eyebrows, Naughty Dog really has pulled out all the stops with this release. This is the definitive way to play one of the best games of the decade, and with a cheap 10 fee for those who own the PS4 original, its a very welcome upgrade.</p>\n</span>', '2024-03-11 17:43:04', '2024-03-11 17:43:04', 'The Last Of Us Part II Remastered Review', 'https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2024/01/tlou-1.jpg?ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=top&auto=format&w=1440&q=80', 'movies', 'https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered/', 'Platforms:PS5 Does a game that came out less than four years ago deserve,...', 'gaming');

A real-time, squad-based tactical survival horror rather than the blazing shooter you might expect, this unbearably tense strategy game takes pages from the <em>Xcom</em> playbook, but gives them a unique and effective twist as you and your squad climb aboard an express elevator to hell. The interface is clunky and the launch version had more than a few (non-Xenomorph) bugs to stamp out but theres no denying how lovingly developer Tindalos title captures the oppressive atmosphere and particular aesthetic of the 1986 sequel. From the whine of the motion tracker, to the crackle of the pulse rifles and even the James Horner-adjacent score, every thread of <em>Dark Descent</em> feels pulled from the movie, making the game an exhilarating ride and even allowing you to customise your marines to reflect their on-screen counterparts (almost mandatory). Its almost impossibly hard at times, but even that plays to the games strengths  the sense of overwhelming horror when you realise that youre boxed in with no way out and no chance of survival is as panic-inducing as James Cameron intended.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/aliens-dark-descent/\" target=\"_blank\">Read the Empire review</a></p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\"></span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<h2><strong>19) Amnesia: The Bunker</strong></h2>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"Amnesia: The Bunker\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/07/amnesia-the-bunker.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/07/amnesia-the-bunker.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/07/amnesia-the-bunker.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/07/amnesia-the-bunker.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/07/amnesia-the-bunker.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/07/amnesia-the-bunker.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/07/amnesia-the-bunker.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4 / PS5, Xbox</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>The <em>Amnesia</em> series has long established itself as one of the best horror franchises around, but <em>The Bunker</em> proves itself the scariest yet. Set in the middle of World War I, players inhabit French solder Henri Clement, trapped in the eponymous underground facility by cowardly superior officers, and hunted by a creature known only as \'The Beast\'. With the monster vulnerable only to light, <em>The Bunker</em> is a masterclass in tension as Henri struggles to keep a lonely generator chugging along just for a measly dim glow. Staying put isn\'t an option though, and every step into the depths searching for a way out or even just fuel for your greatest ally  the generator  is a claustrophobic nightmare. It\'s how the game evolves on its predecessors that impresses though, with the catacombs a semi-open world to explore as you dare, and more opportunities for emergent gameplay thanks to the freedom to experiment with tools.

Running adjacent to James Cameron\'s films, your role as a Na\'vi child raised in human captivity and forced to reconnect with their roots after Sully\'s big screen rebellion fits neatly with the anti-colonialism themes of the movies, while its open-world gameplay is the perfect genre to exhibit the vibrant, living planet.

While a massive departure from what players may expect of the developer, <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> is an absolute blast, with its madcap plot  you play wannabe rock star Chai, whose futuristic iPod gets embedded in his chest in a cybernetic upgrade gone wrong, giving him the ability to fight in time with the beat of the world around him  gorgeous comic book-inspired visuals, and, of course, killer soundtrack making for one of the best surprises of the year.

With returning characters from past <em>Fire Emblems</em> serving as spirit partners to <em>Emblem\'s</em> new cast of heroes  led by Alear, the Divine Dragon, prophesised to save the world of Elyos from the forces of the Fell Dragon  its story was something of a tour of the franchise\'s past. It was in the combat itself that <em>Emblem</em> felt like an evolution though, keeping the specificity o the turn-based model but allowing a spectacular degree of customisation for each warrior. From weapon specialisations to skills inherited from training with those returning figures between battles, there\'s near-infinite potential for how you develop your army. While not quite as ambitious as 2019\'s <em>Three Houses</em>, <em>Emblem</em> serves up all the tactical and strategic planning fans of the series crave, while proving a great entry point for newcomers.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/fire-emblem-engage/\" target=\"_blank\">Read the Empire review</a></p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\"></span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<h2>\n<strong>13) Armored Core VI: Fires Of Rubico</strong>n</h2>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"Fires Of Rubicon\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/ARMORED-CORE-VI-1.jpeg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/ARMORED-CORE-VI-1.jpeg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/ARMORED-CORE-VI-1.jpeg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/ARMORED-CORE-VI-1.jpeg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/ARMORED-CORE-VI-1.jpeg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/ARMORED-CORE-VI-1.jpeg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/ARMORED-CORE-VI-1.jpeg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p><strong>Platform:</strong> PC, PS4 / PS5, Xbox</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Before becoming synonymous with grimdark fantasy epics and gruelling combat with the <em>Dark Souls</em> series, FromSoftware was probably best known for its <em>Armored Core</em> games, where mountainous mechs clash in frenzied battle on a ruined future Earth. It\'s been over a decade since the last entry, but 2023 showed there\'s plenty of fuel in the tank with this resurgent instalment. The plot is loose  humanity is now battling over resources on a distant planet, with your mercenary main character caught between factions  but ultimately plays second fiddle to delivering the searing metal and clashing arms of the real stars: the giant honkin\' robots. Seemingly endless upgrades and customisation options are available to tailor your mech against the legions of war machines you\'ll be clashing with, while generous checkpointing lets you experiment on the fly, and an unexpectedly speedy movement system makes it all feel like you\'re living your mecha anime dreams.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/armored-core-vi-fires-of-rubicon/\">Read the Empire review</a></p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\"></span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<h2><strong>12) Starfield</strong></h2>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"Starfield\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/09/starfield_05_destruction.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/09/starfield_05_destruction.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/09/starfield_05_destruction.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/09/starfield_05_destruction.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/09/starfield_05_destruction.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/09/starfield_05_destruction.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/09/starfield_05_destruction.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p><strong>Platform:</strong> PC, Xbox</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>One of the most ambitious games of the year, if not the decade, <em>Starfield</em> promised players the universe  and <em>almost</em> delivered.

While it all but abandons any lingering pretences of being an RPG, <em>FFXVI</em> still delivers all the weirdness and idiosyncrasies that mark it out as part of the series. Brooding swordsman? Check, in leading man Clive Rosfield. Inscrutable but high stakes politics with the fates of millions in the balance? Check, with the feudal nations of Valisthea, warring over territory using the series\' familiar elemental summons as terrifying weapons of mass destruction. Unexpected emotional gut punches when you least expect them in the story? Check, for many spoileriffic reasons. It\'s all bolstered by one of the smoothest battle systems in years, fast and furious enough for action gamers but with just enough customisation and tactics to satiate the series\' longer term fans. Square Enix risked everything with this wholesale reinvention of what a core, numbered, mainline <em>Final Fantasy</em> can be  and thankfully, that risk paid off.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-xvi/\" target=\"_blank\">Read the Empire review</a></p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\"></span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<h2><strong>9) Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</strong></h2>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"Jedi Survivor\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/04/STAR-WARS-Jedi_-Survivor%E2%84%A2_20230418172747-1.jpeg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/04/STAR-WARS-Jedi_-Survivor%E2%84%A2_20230418172747-1.jpeg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/04/STAR-WARS-Jedi_-Survivor%E2%84%A2_20230418172747-1.jpeg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/04/STAR-WARS-Jedi_-Survivor%E2%84%A2_20230418172747-1.jpeg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/04/STAR-WARS-Jedi_-Survivor%E2%84%A2_20230418172747-1.jpeg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/04/STAR-WARS-Jedi_-Survivor%E2%84%A2_20230418172747-1.jpeg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/023/04/STAR-WARS-Jedi_-Survivor%E2%84%A2_20230418172747-1.jpeg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4 / PS5, Xbox</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Surely it\'s only a matter of time before Cal Kestis makes the leap from games to the big screen, right? After all, the young Jedi  one of scant few to escape Order 66  now has two blockbuster action-adventures to his name, and both are on par with the best of the cinematic <em>Star Wars</em>. Building on 2019\'s <em>Fallen Order</em>, <em>Survivor</em> continues Cal\'s story in the years between the Prequel and Original Trilogies, now working from the shadows against the Empire. Rather than repeat all the tricks of the first game though, developer Respawn has refined everything to perfection  there\'s less planet hopping, but the environments you explore are better realised  bigger, more populated, and filled with meaningful side quests. Cal\'s Jedi skills have evolved too, with five lightsaber stances to tailor responses to every threat the galaxy throws at you, and a few new Force tricks such as animal taming. It\'s all wrapped up in what\'s a contender for 2023\'s best looking game, a dazzlingly realised world that could put Lucasfilm to shame.

And sure, with classic controls, streamlined modern inputs, and even an AI-assisted \'Dynamic\' mode, it\'s the most accessible <em>Street Fighter</em> ever. But what really sets it apart though is World Tour  a <em>Yakuza</em>-lite, RPG-esque mode where your deliriously customisable fighter travels the globe, learning \"the true meaning of strength\" from key characters, all while getting into scraps with everyone from passing office workers to cardboard box-wearing delinquents.

With bountiful potential for character builds and a giddying amount of loot dropping from every fell beast and greedy bandit you slay to customise them with, there\'s no end to <em>Diablo IV\'s</em> dark delights.</p>\n</san><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/diablo-iv/\" target=\"_blank\">Read the Empire review</a></p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\"></span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<h2><strong>6) Resident Evil 4</strong></h2>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"Resident Evil 4\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/03/residnet-evil-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/03/residnet-evil-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/03/residnet-evil-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/03/residnet-evil-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/03/residnet-evil-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/03/residnet-evil-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/03/residnet-evil-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4 / PS5, Xbox</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>2023 was in some ways the year of the remake  see also, <em>System Shock, Dead Space, Metroid Prime: Remastered</em>  but when they\'re as good as this reimagined <em>Resi 4</em>, we can\'t complain. Leon S Kennedys Spanish vacation, taking in the sights and sounds of dilapidated towns and meeting (not-so-)friendly parasite-infected villagers as he tries to rescue the US presidents daughter, was an immediate high point for the series back in 2005, and nearly two decades later, Capcom has made it even better. It all looks stunning, of course, but its small mechanical refinements that have outsized impacts, elevating the whole experience. The new ability to crouch, for instance, further heightens the fear factor as you try to sneak around undetected, while being able to parry attacks with your knife reduces the original\'s reliance on quick-time events. Along with some judicious tweaking of the plot, better explaining the origins of Las Plagas parasites and further establishing supporting characters, this is the definitive version of arguably the best <em>Resi</em> game.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/resident-evil-4-2023/\" target=\"_blank\">Read the Empire review</a></p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\"></span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<h2><strong>5) Alan Wake II</strong></h2>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"Alan Wake II\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/alan-wake-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/alan-wake-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/alan-wake-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/alan-wake-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/alan-wake-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/alan-wake-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/alan-wake-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p><strong>Platform:</strong> PC, PS5, Xbox</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>After 2019\'s <em>Control</em> revealed the events of the original <em>Alan Wake</em> were merely one case investigated by the mysterious Federal Bureau of Control, the thought of returning for another dose of weirdness focused on the titular tormented horror writer felt small. Those fears proved unfounded though, as <em>Alan Wake II</em> takes some of the biggest and best ideas from its shared universe sibling and weaves them into a multilayered tale that will have you questioning reality itself. Alternating between Wake, trapped in a twisted reality seemingly drawn from his own novels, and new character Saga Anderson, an FBI agent investigating a string of murders in the setting of the first game, this leans more into survival horror than either of its predecessors, but doesn\'t lose any of the deranged charm writer/director Sam Lake infuses into his works.

Amazingly, this surpasses it by focusing on both Spectacular Spider-Men at once, offering a classic Marvel Team-Up as players swap between Miles and Peter, allowing them to protect the sensationally realised New York  now expanded to include Brooklyn and Queens  with either of the webbed wonders\' unique power sets. Stakes are ratcheted even higher with the introduction of fan-favourite Venom, but unlike Sam Raimi (forced to include the villain in 2007\'s <em>Spider-Man 3</em>), developer Insomniac actually wants the monstrous antihero in its game, and the symbiote\'s presence  and the impact it has on Peter  adds a powerful twist to how the saga spins out. Like all the best comics though, the real strength of <em>Spider-Man 2</em> is in its characters, balancing blow-out action sequences with heart-rending moments of personal drama.

Orphaned as a child, youve been raised in the Resource Development Administration\'s insidious The Ambassador Program  referred to as TAP throughout the game  structured as an attempt to mould young Na\'vi into accepting human perspectives to bridge the gap with Pandora\'s other inhabitants. Jake Sully\'s rebellion at the end of the first movie creates an escape window, however.

This is deliberate: there\'s even an option to switch between \'guided\' and \'exploration\' modes in the settings. Unfortunately, even with the former selected, reliably keeping on target for quests or finding the right suporting character to speak to can be tricky. Wandering and taking in the splendour is plenty of fun for a while  especially when you stumble upon an RDA mining rig or other such polluting infrastructure, destroying it to restore health to the surrounding environment  but when you want to actually progress the story, youll spend a good chunk of time squeezing the button to activate your Navi senses, just to spot the glowing highlight marking your next stop.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p><em>Frontiers Of Pandora</em> does pack in some smart twists to the open-world formula though, such as character levelling being largely down to the quality of the gear you craft rather than an XP grind, incentivising you to hone those Navi abilities and hunter-gatherer skills to forge better equipment. Foraging plays a role here, too  components can be damaged during harvesting, or have better properties depending on where and in what weather conditions you gather them, meaning you might be able to craft a better, more powerful version of a beloved weapon or favourite piece of armour if you scout out and collect components at the perfect time. It\'s a great addition that touches on the core philosophies of the Navi that we\'ve seen so far on screen, and firmly roots you in the world around you.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Combat also leans heavily into craftsmanship  while you have access to firearms, mighty bows hewn from Pandoran lumber often feel far more powerful. Longbows and hunting bows therefore become go-to weapons over shotguns and rifles, especially once you unlock skills that expand your carrying capacity. There\'s something very special about taking down an RDA mech with a single arrow to its exhaust port, then scurrying to cover while enemies begin to panic. If you prefer your battles to be a bit less stealthy though, you\'ll eventually be able to rip humans right out of their armoured frames, a technique that really sells the imposing stature and power of the Navi.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>While many of the skills, abilities, and general gameplay mechanics in <em>Frontiers Of Pandora</em> will be familiar to anyone who\'s played similar games, it\'s the framing that elevates this beyond a reskinned <em><a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/assassins-creed-mirage/\" target=\"_blank\">Assassin\'s Creed</a></em>. Theres a grander objective threaded through the game of reuniting three tribes of Navi, allowing for a deeper examination of the distinct cultures that make up this fascinating world, in much the same way that <em><a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/avatar-the-way-of-water/\" target=\"_blank\">The Way Of Water</a></em> introduced more clans. Meanwhile, the RDAs efforts to control the very soul of the Navi by trying to effectively brainwash their Sarentu tale weavers through TAP perfectly matches Cameron\'s big screen exploration of the evils of colonialism and exploitation  and draws clear comparison to the real-world horror of the stolen generations of children taken from indigenous cultures here on Earth. Yes, it\'s about as subtle as Unobtainium, but it absolutely fits the themes of the <em>Avatar</em> universe so far.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/12/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-4.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/12/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-4.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/12/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-4.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/12/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-4.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/12/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-4.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/12/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-4.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/12/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-4.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p><em>Frontiers Of Pandora</em> ultimately doesn\'t chart much new ground, but it does marvellously tailor the open-world form to <em>Avatars</em> mythology.

Its combat leans heavily into real-time attacks, with one party member directly controlled, and the remainder operating according to pre-assigned instructions  for instance, setting Rena to focus on healing. However, you can also issue direct commands and use items from a menu system, or swap the actively controlled character at will, if you fancy using a particular skill manually. How and when to best make these switches is a fine art though, as if you\'re interrupted mid-action, you\'ll sacrifice a bonus gauge that can boost your efficacy in combat. Then there are a host of battle formations to learn and utilise, changing the default positioning and efficacy of party members in combat.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>That\'s all just scratching the surface of combat, too  character growth and skills have their own deeply complex systems to master. There are dozens of abilities to be learned, some used in battle an enhanced by spending BP earned after battle, others used at calmer points to cook, craft items, customise weapons, or sundry other actions, which are all improved by spending SP, a separate resource.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>It is, by any measure, hideously complicated in places, especially when you factor in that the usual JRPG character growth metrics  attack, defence, intelligence, and so on  are impacted by seemingly disconnected skills. For instance, increasing Claude\'s Aesthetic Design stat (yes, really), bumps up the numbers on his attack, hit rate, chance to avoid enemy attacks, and spell-casting power.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Yet from that complexity comes brilliant ways to twist the world of<em>Star Ocean</em>to your liking. Invest in Scouting, and you\'ll be able to decrease or increase the rate of enemy encounters; increase it, and more enemies will spawn, which can then be fought in sequential chain battles that offer escalating amounts of experience to level up faster. Or pump some SP into Writing and you\'ll be able to pen books that unlock skills earlier. Your base weapon not hitting that sweet spot of lethality?

The general narrative progression is a basic formula of \"go here, solve problem, beat boss, repeat\", but now there\'s occasionally a glossy CGI cutscene to add a bit of pizzazz. Those new characters get the lion\'s share of development and focus along the way, allowing Mario, Peach, and Bowser to retain their standing as largely archetypal ciphers. It all works, and it\'s packed with charming, delightful, and often genuinely funny moments, but don\'t expect anything that\'s going to leave you scratching your head over the hidden meaning of it all.</p>\n</span><div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__ynq1g\" data-test=\"pullquote\">\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__icon__JGpkh\"><span></span></div>\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__content__gRuai\">\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A joyful adventure, packed with brilliantly clever, touching, or adorably weird moments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Across the board though, what\'s really remarkable is how<em>little</em>2023\'s<em>Super Mario RPG</em>deviates from the original, and not just on the story front. While the visual upgrade is impressive, it\'s all in service to area and world design that precisely recreates the SNES version, right down to the location of invisible hidden chests. Even the translation is nigh-identical, barring a handful of tweaks to bring things into line with Nintendo\'s more codified 21st century<em>Mario</em>lore  Princess Toadstool, as she was known in the original, is Princess Peach here.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Where there are entirely new additions, they almost feel cautious on Nintendo\'s part. Some, such as the inclusion of a scrapbook feature to recap the story are welcome (who hasn\'t returned to an RPG after a few weeks away, only to find they have no idea what they were doing?), as are boss fight rematches, adding a degree of replayability. Others though, including a bestiary of defeated enemies and an Easy Mode that makes the already unchallenging game even more of a cake walk, feel like the result of wanting to add<em>something</em>new while also being careful not to alter anything too significantly.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"Super Mario RPG\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/11/mario-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/11/mario-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/11/mario-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/11/mario-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/11/mario-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/11/mario-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/11/mario-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Combat is the main area where changes have been made, although still nothing that rocks the boat. This retains all the hallmarks of a Square game from 1996, with turn-based battles, status effects to inflict or avoid, and ability-enhancing equipment to kit your party out with. Most updates are subtle  while the original introduced well-timed action commands to increase damage dealt to enemies, this expands it so a perfectly timed tap of the attack button when landing a blow deals splash damage to all enemies. Similarly, well-timed guards can mitgate enemy damage entirely, but foes now indicate when an attack can\'t be dodged at all. A bigger shift, Triple Attacks, now allow powerful group moves to be used when a gauge has been filled via all those well-timed action commands, but it\'s nothing genre fans won\'t have seen elsewhere  by any measure, this is a simple, almost entry level JRPG.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>And yet, it\'s almost impossible not to fall in love with<em>Super Mario RPG</em>, then or now. Despite its simplicity  the greatest obstacle most players will face is likely to be a couple of rhythm-matching mini-games that never seem to actually match rhythms  it\'s a joyful adventure, packed with brilliantly clever, touching, or adorably weird moments that Mario fans old and new will be captivated by.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Ultimately, the Switch incarnation of<em>Super Mario RPG</em>feels more of an exercise in game preservation; less a remake, more a slavish recreation. This iteration is utterly faithful to the original, for better (an option to swap between composer Yoko Shimomura\'s wonderful original score or a newly arranged version) and worse (an experience that, overall, still feels like a nearly 30-year-old game). The game remains worthy of its legendary, influential status  no<em>Super Mario RPG</em>, no<em>Paper Mario</em>or<em>Mario &amp; Luigi</em> but, by design, this is a love letter to a bygone era.</p>\n</span>', '2024-03-11 17:43:04', '2024-03-11 17:43:04', 'Super Mario RPG Review', 'https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/11/mario-3.jpg?ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=top&auto=format&w=1440&q=80', 'movies', 'https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/super-mario-rpg/', 'Platforms:Nintendo Switch The originalSuper Mario RPGwas a...', 'gaming');

Every hero\'s charge skill is different though, and getting to grips with each of them, plus their special skills in battle, can create endlessly inventive synergies. Voltages, meanwhile, are more like<em>Final Fantasy\'s</em>Limit Breaks, charging over time by dealing and taking damage and, when full, unlocking an incredibly powerful move.<em>Tactica</em>gradually, but constantly, increases the battle options available to the player, and while there\'s never anything truly ground-breaking that fans of the genre won\'t have seen, battles are always entertaining.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Perhaps the biggest departure from<em>Persona 5</em>itself  beyond the art direction, which here adopts a super-deformed aesthetic, although seemingly further influenced in places by the works of Kunihiko Ikuhara  is in the Personas themselves. Where before these were essentially demonic Pokmon, recruited in battle, now they\'re more like items, collected in the form of strange gears dropped as rewards. Where normally Joker is the only member of the Phantom Thieves to be able to use multiple Personas, in<em>Tactica</em>each squad member can equip a secondary Persona, boosting their stats or altering which spells and abilities they have access to in battle. As in<em>P5</em>, Personas can still be merged into more powerful forms  a key tool for unlocking more powerful Personas, beyond mere level grinding  but the new \'gear\' approach does make them feel more disposable.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Oddly, the one thing holding<em>Tactica</em>back from greatness is just how familiar it all feels. We kind of expect<em>Persona</em>games to do something unexpected or off-kilter, but while this still has plenty of weird ideas and situations to wrap your head around, its root play styles and mechanics don\'t deviate far from other examples of the turn-based strategy genre. It\'s still a fun time, with plenty of versatility in how to approach each battle and a huge amount of replayability  each stage can be revisited endlessly, allowing you to test new party configurations or chase bonus completion criteria  and, for returning fans, it\'s great to revisit these characters, but it just doesn\'t quite hit the lofty heights of its progenitor.</p>\n</span>', '2024-03-11 17:43:04', '2024-03-11 17:43:04', 'Persona 5 Tactica Review', 'https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/11/tactica-4.jpg?ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=top&auto=format&w=1440&q=80', 'movies', 'https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/persona-5-tactica/', 'Platforms:Nintendo Switch, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC...', 'gaming'),

Soon though, it\'s the now overly familiar experience of running around and gunning down faceless enemy forces, switching between protagonists almost every chapter as the story tries to build to a meaningful denouement. (Spoiler: it fails.)</p>\n</span><div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__ynq1g\" data-test=\"pullquote\">\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__icon__JGpkh\"><span></span></div>\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__content__gRuai\">\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"An open-map shooter shouldn\'t feel boring or predictable, but it does.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>In Sledgehammer\'s defence, the studio clearly wants to do more here. The single biggest addition is the introduction of open combat missions, intended to move the campaign away from the series\' tendency for glorified corridor runs in favour of expansive maps with multiple goals that can be tackled in any order to complete the overall objectives. It has potential, but feels let down by chore-like aims (GPS tag some crates, destroy X number of things) and no real stakes. There\'s the illusion of being able to try different approaches to achieve your goals, but in reality it\'s all dull shootouts  there\'s no point attempting stealth, for example, when groups of enemies are clustered around every target. An open-map shooter shouldn\'t feel boring or predictable, but it does.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Even <em>Modern Warfare III</em>\'s multiplayer offerings, <em>CoD</em>\'s bread and butter, feel phoned in, largely recycling maps and modes from its predecessor. Cutthroat, a \'new\' nine-player mode  three teams of three players  attempts to introduce some squad-based strategy, but ultimately feels like an update of Gunfight, while almost everything else is the epitome of \"been there, done that\". Zombies, meanwhile, remains a somewhat deranged delight, abandoning the po-faced seriousness of the campaign and competitive multiplayer for a PvE battle against hordes of undead. Yet here, a shift to larger maps and extraction objectives makes for an experience that feels more like <em>Warzone</em> crossed with <em>DMZ</em>. It just doesn\'t impress as it once did, and overly long 45-minute matches drain it of any remaining fun.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/11/CODMW3-3-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/11/CODMW3-3-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/11/CODMW3-3-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/11/CODMW3-3-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/11/CODMW3-3-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/11/CODMW3-3-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/11/CODMW3-3-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>As an added bonus, you can experience all of that mediocrity for the low, low cost of almost all your device storage. <em>Modern Warfare III</em> eats up over 200GB, but that\'s just the download size  you need more space still for files to install onto, before some is clawed back once it\'s done.

The central story weaves itself into the tapestry of the series\' existing canon, too, centred around Detroit Police Department\'s conflict with The Torch Heads, an anarcho-punk criminal gang with links to the Nuke narcotic that acts as the central MacGuffin of <em>RoboCop 2</em>.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Even the game\'s litany of cheesy one-liners, in danger of coming across as hokey and wooden almost anywhere else, seem to fit right at home within this B-movie world of cyberpunk satire. If anything\'s missing, then, it\'s perhaps some of the sociopolitical subtext that lent 1987\'s <em>RoboCop</em> its edge. Alex Murphy\'s comically techno-fascist approach to justice is certainly on display here, but is presented without comment, indulging in the gratification of his violence without asking players to really consider the insidious forces guiding his Prime Directives.</p>\n</span><div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__ynq1g\" data-test=\"pullquote\">\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__icon__JGpkh\"><span></span></div>\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__content__gRuai\">\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When it comes to gameplay, <em>Rogue City</em> refuses to compromise on the spirit of its central character, and is all the better for it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>You will, at least, be given some agency in considering how those Prime Directives are fulfilled, with multiple endings and mission outcomes depending on how you\'ve closed cases, engaged with Detroit\'s citizens, and maintained public order.

True to form, RoboCop neither runs  nor even lightly jogs  towards justice, but instead methodically stomps into each combat situation, soaking up enough gunfire to make the act of taking cover almost pointless. In this way, Rogue City offers a first-person shooter experience that plays quite unlike any other, not so much subverting the genre\'s stereotypes as it does march right through them with the same gusto with which Murphy stubbornly ploughs concrete, plasterboard, and any other obstacle in his way.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/11/Robocop-3.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/11/Robocop-3.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/11/Robocop-3.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/11/Robocop-3.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/11/Robocop-3.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/11/Robocop-3.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/11/Robocop-3.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>There is, of course, plenty of shooting to be done, too.

However, while the familiar figure of Gimli leads the Dwarven efforts here  with John Rhys-Davies returning to voice his iconic role from the Peter Jackson films  you\'ll play a custom character trapped underground after an explosive attempt to bypass a stubborn magic gate goes awry.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"The Lord Of The Rings: Return To Moria\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/moria-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/moria-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/moria-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/moria-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/moria-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/moria-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/moria-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>The character creator is one of the best things about<em>Return To Moria</em>, with an impressive suite of customisation options.

Annoyingly though, these facilities have to be crafted at each base camp you set up as you edge further into the mines, which leads to either a great deal of repetitive grinding to build multiple instances, or a hell of a lot of back-and-forth as you march hauls of rare materials to the particular device you need to turn them into something truly useful.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>And much as<em>Minecraft\'s</em>Steve is regularly assailed by zombies while rying to survive, there are plenty of enemies lurking in the shadows of the underdark to make that back-and-forth more treacherous. While Sauron has been defeated by this point, not all of his minions have got the message, and so the mines of Moria are still infested with orcs, wargs, poison-spitting spiders, and more  the high fantasy version of those WW2 soldiers you hear about, shipwrecked on islands for decades, not knowing the conflict is over. Unfortunately,<em>Return To Moria\'s</em>combat is disappointingly basic, a flailing of weapons against mostly unthinking foes. Short of being swarmed or caught by surprise, there\'s little threat, just frustration as they impede your exploration.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>One big difference that sets<em>Moria</em>apart from<em>Minecraft</em> although not necessarily for the better  is that it\'s far more structured. While game worlds are procedurally generated, making each player\'s experience slightly different between major areas, the ancient walls and corridors of Khazad-dm can\'t be broken or mined through no matter how fancy a tool you craft  there\'s no setting up neat and easy connections between locations. It is, at least, in keeping with the sense of Moria being bewilderingly labyrinthine just as Tolkien imagined, for better or worse.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Ultimately, it\'s that sense of adherence to the source material that saves<em>Return To Moria</em>from total ignominy. That aforementioned Tolkien paint job is mostly a well presented one, from the architectural and aesthetic touches to the regular helpings of lore to be discovered on the journey. At almost every level, this feels like an authentic foray into Middle-earth  but it\'s that same adherence that means this is only really going to connect with hardcore Tolkien hounds in the first place.</p>\n</span>', '2024-03-11 17:43:04', '2024-03-11 17:43:04', 'The Lord Of The Rings: Return To Moria Review', 'https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/moria-3.jpg?ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=top&auto=format&w=1440&q=80', 'movies', 'https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria/', 'Platforms:PC (PS5, Xbox Series X|S to follow) Fans ofThe Lord Of...', 'gaming');

The game capitalises threefold on that running in-joke, with Lake now the face of a detective named Alex Casey as well as his curious doppelgnger and even a version of Lake himself. But it never feelsself-aggrandising. As well as being funny, it even becomes thematically important, that one shared face spiralling into a wealth of great character moments. Its but one demonstration of the wonderful, beguiling meta-fiction of this sequel to 2010s<em>Alan Wake,</em>with exciting connections to Remedy\'s 2019 game <em>Control:</em>inheriting some of the latters visual motifs (giant title treatments, live-action footage) and some of the characters.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p><em>Alan Wake II</em>follows two protagonists, in parallel chapters that you can play in any order.

Those killings take Saga down a strange rabbit hole, as she stumbles across possessed people called Taken, and townsfolk who suddenly treat her like shes lived there her entire life. The other thread follows Alan Wake himself, an author who, in the previous game, discovered that his fiction was becoming real, and that his writing could change reality. Hes now trapped in a parallel nightmare dimension known as the Dark Place, here appearing as a rain-slicked version of New York, emblematic of the noir fiction that the in-game author Alan made his name on.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"Alan Wake II\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/alan-wake-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/alan-wake-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/alan-wake-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/alan-wake-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/alan-wake-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/alan-wake-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/alan-wake-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Thedense,<em>Twin Peaks</em>and Stephen King-flavoured narrative turns the very constraints of genre into something working against the characters, Saga and Wake both bristling against the archetypal roles theyre being made to fulfil. The cast is magnetic in portraying how the Dark Place has fragmented their very beings, showing multiple sides of themselves: the storytelling clichs that we see in the Dark Place, the more nuanced characters we meet in the real world, and where they overlap.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>They feel trapped, and that oppressiveness bleeds through to combat. The action is incredibly deliberate, and sometimes punishing, a balance of precision aiming, dodging and strategic retreat. It carries forward the conceit of the first game  enemies are shrouded in a supernatural darkness, you use sources of light, mainly a torch, to burn it away and make them vulnerable to gunfire. Encounters are tense, checkpoints are sparse, characters are slow, the weapons feel weighty and unpredictable and ammo can be scarce. Compared to the first game, this is more survival horror  a very natural shift in direction, like it was always meant to be. This isnt to diminish how fun it is, especially when Lakes goofy sense of humour pokes through, in bizarre environments (like a coffee-themed theme park) and outrageous set-pieces (there is more than one musical sequence).</p>\n</span><div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__ynq1g\" data-test=\"pullquote\">\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__icon__JGpkh\"><span></span></div>\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__content__gRuai\">\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A frequently breathtaking work of mixed-media storytelling.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Outside of fighting for your life (some boss fights are surprisingly tough), the most striking element is how this time around the story itself is a puzzle, the player taking part in piecing it together, detective-style. Instead of a quest list or objective screen, you haveSagas\'Mind Place (apparently different from a Mind Palace) and Alan Wakes extra-dimensional Writers Room, both reachable with the press of a button. These are interactive menus that act as a navigable space, a pleasingly tactile way of sifting through the games lore and the storys various twists. As Saga, you piece quests together on a case board, compiling evidence. In Wakes chapters, its a Plot Board, where you change pieces of a scene to solve puzzles, as editing a scene edits the environment around you. It feels appropriately ritualistic  sequences where Saga profiles people seem more like communing with the dead than psychological analysis. Its all aided by slick presentation  with an instantaneous switch between the real world and these locations, its striking gamification of the mental processes that we could only see passively in the first game.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>The world itself also feels like a puzzle: its levels are all strange liminal spaces, the world subtly shifting to throw you off balance. Furthering that uncanny atmosphere is its transitions between its incredibly detailed and expressive in-game animation and live-action performance, often overlapping the two. Like in<em>Control</em>,<em>Alan Wake II</em>interpolates video footage of real actors, superimposed over the game environment. At a time wherecinematicgames rule the AAA space,<em>Alan Wake II</em>stands out as one with a genuinelyexperimental visual ethos.Appropriately for a game about fighting the darkness with light sources, it leans on areas that turn single light-sources into its own kind of horror: it feels like theres something lurking around every corner, and the cold neon lights of Alans nightmare NYC stand out all the more, contrasted with the warm pine forests and mountains (and quirky towns) of Bright Falls.<em>Alan Wake II</em>is technically impressive, too, particularlyin the immediacy when switching to the Wrters Room and Mind Place, as well as the moments where Wake rearranges the world around him. Even in performance mode (which loses some visual definition in favour of a solid 60fps), its gorgeous production design makes for some of the prettiest imagery of the year, spectacular to behold even at its most unnerving.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p><em>Alan Wake II</em>is a frequently breathtaking work of mixed-media storytelling, not just a game that aspires to become cinematic or televisual or even literary, but one that asks how it might integrate those different artistic languages, how gameplay can experiment with and transform the storytelling experience, and how environmental design and (often literal) gameplay loops can reflect a character study. If its all going to be as ambitious as this, we hope the Remedy-verse keeps on expanding.</p>\n</span>', '2024-03-11 17:43:04', '2024-03-11 17:43:04', 'Alan Wake II Review', 'https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/alan-wake-1.jpg?ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=top&auto=format&w=1440&q=80', 'movies', 'https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/alan-wake-ii/', 'Platforms:PS5, PC, Xbox Inone of Remedy Entertainments earliest...', 'gaming'),

Cue racing around six worlds, gathering key items  Wonder Seeds  and dispatching Bowser\'s underlings, before tackling the lethal lizard himself. It\'s not going to win Nintendo any awards for storytelling, but points for not having Bowser kidnap Princess Peach again.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Better still, you can play<em>as</em>Peach, or any of Mario\'s pals, in fact. That\'s not a first for the series by any stretch, but<em>Wonder</em>does boast the largest playable cast ever, with Mario himself backed up by Luigi, Peach, Princess Daisy, three flavours of Toad, four multicoloured Yoshis, and Nabbit, the thieving rabbit<em>thing</em>that\'s become an increasingly visible side character in the series since his first appearance back in 2012. While the humans and toads play identically, Yoshi and Nabbit have a unique twist  they don\'t take damage from enemies, but also won\'t be able to transform using the game\'s new power-up items. Invulnerability might sound like a big step up, but given some of those transformation items can be crucial for gathering each stage\'s collectibles, it can actually be quite the handicap. Plus, if you\'re navigating<em>Wonder\'s</em>worlds in multiplayer  the game supports up to four players  someone playing Yoshi can let others ride on their back, which is both adorable and another<em>Super Mario World</em>callback.</p>\n</span><div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__ynq1g\" data-test=\"pullquote\">\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__icon__JGpkh\"><span></span></div>\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__content__gRuai\">\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Wonder\'s</em>whole approach to design, and how design impacts play, is deliriously delightful.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Perhaps the biggest gameplay shift though is the array of badges that can be equipped, each of which adds or tweaks an ability. These are different to traditional<em>Mario</em>power-ups in that they\'re not form changes, but rather modifiers to movement, which can drastically alter progression through levels. For example, the Dolphin Kick badges grants a surge of momentum when swimming, allowing you to better navigate underwater areas or chase down fast-moving foes, while the Parachute Cap introduces a slow glide from a jump, making wider gaps navigable. Other badges don\'t affect the character but rather the world, adding new blocks or earning extra coins for beating bad guys. Only one badge can be equipped at a time though, and can\'t be swapped mid-level, which adds a nice degree of replayability  especially as you may need to return to completed courses with a different badges ability to reach new areas or overcome obstacles.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Like all the best<em>Mario</em>games,<em>Wonder</em>starts off simply but rapidly gets much more challenging. The first few courses are almost literal walks in the park, strolling to the right of the Flower Kingdom\'s bucolic stages with nary a care in the world, just gently learning what new power-ups such as the Elephant form can do (barrel through obstacles, flick enemies away with a swing of the trunk, and spray plants with water, as it happens) or how badges work in practice. Pretty soon though, you\'ll see Nintendo\'s more sadistic tendencies creep in, with even some early levels in Pipe-Rock Plateau  the very first world  requiring multiple passes to scoop up every last collectible.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"Super Mario Bros.

Not only are there the hundreds of pivotal Wonder Seeds to gather, but each main stage will have a trio of giant-sized Flower Coins to hunt down, many of them hidden. You\'ll even need to grab the highest point on every single one of the now-familiar course-ending flag poles if you want to truly 100%<em>Wonder</em>, a task that proves an increasingly gruelling test of platforming skills as the game advances.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Yet in typical Nintendo fashion, between those devilishly difficult moments are peppered flashes of pure joy. Sometimes it\'s just breathers, with levels literally called \"Break Time\"  short, fun tasks to earn a Wonder Seed  or cathartic challenges to rampage through a host of enemies in short order. In other cases, it\'s the must-pass levels that block off progress, but instead of demanding pixel-perfect platforming, they simply ask you to do something deranged, like outrun a<a href=\"https://www.mariowiki.com/Wiggler\" rel=\"noopener\">Wiggler</a>on roller skates. Or it might just be the way the game ferrets away little secrets, like hidden portals that lead to encounters with a wandering Captain Toad, or even subtle animation touches, with Goombas actually biting Mario and co. now, as Shigeru Miyamoto always wanted them to back in the series\' 8-bit origins. Everywhere you look,<em>Wonder</em>is doing something to make you smile, and it makes the entire game feel infectiously happy.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p><em>Wonder\'s</em>whole approach to design, and how design impacts play, is deliriously delightful too. The other new power-ups are weird enough, with drill-headed and water-bubble-firing forms to discover  the latter sort of an inversion of the long-standing fire flower, which also returns  but then there\'s a new item called a Wonder Flower that warps the entire reality of each level when collected. Pick one up, and you might find yourself running along the backs of a herd of stampeding<a href=\"https://www.mariowiki.com/Bulrush\" rel=\"noopener\">Bulrushes</a>, riding wriggling pipes, or in an entirely different environment altogether. Throw in dozens of entirely new enemy types, and<em>Super Mario Bros.

In the world of the dead, you might be able to flay the soul of a tormented wretch, activating some infernal mechanism to activate a bridge of bones.

While this can be reclaimed by retaliating, taking even one solid hit means the lost health is gone for good. This might not be such a problem  indeed, its exactly the sort of problem the biggest fans of soulsborne games seem to relish, challenging them to git gud and balance that ebb and flow of health  if not for a camera system that seems to actively hide enemies (whether youre locked on to a primary target or not), meaning youll often take damage without realising it. Being able to dodge, deflect, and retaliate_should_make you feel like youre dominating the enemy, but instead it too often feels like youre being sucker punched.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p><em>Lords Of The Fallen</em>is also victim to some unfortunate timing. Coming so soon after the release of<em>Lies Of P</em>, which mixed up the genres ingredients with its corrupted belle poque aesthetic, makes exploring yet another grimdark fantasy world here feel regressive. Even the layered worlds twist doesnt help much  Axiom and Umbral are grim and grimmer, the latter an exaggeration of the former, its darkness ratcheted up to 11.

If not for the genuinely brilliant dual worlds approach and the fun twists soul flaying adds to combat  and for the impressively grotesque bosses youll encounter along the way  this would feel like every other soulsborne that follows in FromSoftwares footsteps.

On one, you have Playground Games\'<em>Horizon</em>spin-off, the open- world, festival-themed, vaguely fantastical outing that\'s all about wish fulfilment  driving supercars around volcanoes or through waterfalls, blasting your favourite tunes on the radio, and oh-by-the-way there are also some races if you can be bothered. On the other, there\'s the progenitor, Turn 10 Studios\'<em>Motorsport</em>, a very serious sim for very serious players, the kind of people who obsess over things like fuel load and its impact on acceleration, or how the design of an obscure sprocket somewhere affects aerodynamics.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>For years, the racing lanes have been separate, but for the latest<em>Forza Motorsport</em>, there\'s a hint of<em>Horizon\'s</em>laissez-faire attitude nipping at its wheels. Make no mistake, this is still that serious sim for serious players, but Turn 10 leans a bit more into cinematic territory here, better selling the sheer awe of tearing up some of the world\'s most iconic race-tracks and the spectacle of crucial race days.

This<em>Motorsport</em> feels more accessible than any before it, easing players in with a host of assists to introduce concepts like following racing lines or how to control 1,400kg of metal careening around a track at 90mph, or how and what best to customise on a vehicle, before gently taking its foot off the metaphorical brakes and allowing players to experiment and make their own mistakes.</p>\n</span><div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__ynq1g\" data-test=\"pullquote\">\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__icon__JGpkh\"><span></span></div>\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__content__gRuai\">\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Overhauled physics and, notably, improved tyre mechanics, all lend a greater sense of control to even unseasoned racers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Chances are, you\'ll make plenty, especially if you\'re coming in with that laid-back<em>Horizon</em>mindset.<em>Motorsport</em>2023 is almost unforgivingly accurate at times, and anyone thinking just holding down the accelerator is enough to win won\'t be taking to the podium at the end of any of the game\'s championship seasons. Accuracy and professionalism matter here  cut a corner, clip a rival, or otherwise ignore the rules, and you\'ll get hit by some pretty brutal time penalties that can massively alter your overall ranking. Oddly, though, that same accuracy sometimes makes races more approachable  overhauled physics and, notably, improved tyre mechanics making for a more authentic feeling of grip as rubber meets asphalt, all lend a greater sense of control to even unseasoned racers.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>2023\'s<em>Motorsport</em>packs in plenty of modes to test your driving skills, from online ranked Rivals mode that sees you competing for best lap times to the simple Free Play, allowing you to potter around tracks with about as low a sense of stakes as the game offers. The Career mode is the big one, though, and perhaps one of the most controversial elements of the game. Turn 10 describes it as \"ongoing and ever-growing\", but take that as \"online and never-ending\". It\'s intended to evolve over the course of the game\'s life cycle, constantly offering new heights for competitive drivers to reach  which probably explains the decision to drop any numerical suffix for this instalment in the series  but at launch it lacks variety, with genre-typical challenges and a relatively small assortment of tracks.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Similarly truncated is the roster of vehicles, which feels an odd thing to say when there are still over 500 cars here. Compared to earlier entries in the franchise with over 700, though, it feels a slight step down. However, it\'s a case of quality over quantity, with each and every car recreated near flawlessly, right down to the pitch-perfect roar of every engine. Acquiring your fleet can feel slow going  you\'re typically encouraged to stick to one car at a time, putting it through its paces, particularly in Career, before moving on. And, to slow things down further, there\'s also a bit of a CarPG feel to<em>Motorsport</em>at times, with vehicles needing to be levelled up  earning XP through skilled driving such as perfect cornering or overtaking opponents  before you can customise them. Compared to<em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, which practically erupted with vehicles much like the calderas you\'d then drive them around, it makes<em>Motorsport</em>feel like a bit more of a grind.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Then again, that might not matter. As mentioned, you probably already know if you\'re a<em>Horizon</em>or a<em>Motorsport</em>racer at heart. While this outing does more than perhaps any sim before it to be accessible and welcoming, it\'s still not going to really win over the party-going players who dig the chill vibes of<em>Horizon</em>. But then, if it did, it would destroy everything sim fans love about<em>Motorsport</em>. And its those people who will get the most out of this  a hardcore racing experience that delivers everything adherents of the form crave. Its pace and progression systems can grate slightly, and it could really do with more track variety, but if Turn 10 can expand and evolve it as is seemingly planned,<em>Forza Motorsport</em>could become a new industry standard.<p>\n</span>', '2024-03-11 17:43:04', '2024-03-11 17:43:04', 'Forza Motorsport (2023) Review', 'https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/forza-2.jpg?ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=top&auto=format&w=1440&q=80', 'movies', 'https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/forza-motorsport-2023/', 'Platforms:PC, Xbox Series X|S Chances are that if youre a fan of...', 'gaming'),

Indeed, it might yet prove to be, once the secretive \"Codename: Hexe\" and \"Codename: Red\" entries see the light.

Yet \"smaller\" also means \"denser\", presenting players with an expanse that doesn\'t feel quite so daunting to explore, but richer for the limited scale.<em>Mirage</em>is full of busy marketplaces and crowded streets; a living, breathing world positively packed with people that feels like a veritable hub of civilisation. There are still many of the hallmarks players have come to expect from the series, from area-scanning synch points and Leaps of Faith into reliable bales of hay, to plenty of side objectives marked on a map to be checked off at will, but it\'s not all quite so spread out for the mere sake of drawing you to the other side of an implausibly large map.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"Assassin\'s Creed Mirage\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/assassins-creed-mirage-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/assassins-creed-mirage-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/assassins-creed-mirage-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/assassins-creed-mirage-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/assassins-creed-mirage-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/assassins-creed-mirage-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/assassins-creed-mirage-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>The bigger shift, though, is in reversing the character and enemy levelling introduced from<em>Origins</em>onwards.

For as much as<em>Origins</em>through<em>Valhalla</em>did right, it was always frustrating that you could no longer, well, assassinate enemies. The XP-driven level scaling of those games led to bizarre outcomes like firing an arrow into a foe\'s skull and their only reaction being to become aware of your presence rather than dying, just because they were 10 arbitrary levels higher than you. In<em>Mirage</em>, that\'s gone  so long as you don\'t draw too much attention, you\'re once again a blade in the darkness, and the game feels better for it.</p>\n</span><div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__ynq1g\" data-test=\"pullquote\">\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__icon__JGpkh\"><span></span></div>\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__content__gRuai\">\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Fittingly, for a series that plays with real world history,<em>Mirage</em>brings together the past and present of<em>Assassin\'s Creed</em>, and makes a case for its future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>That\'s not to say Mirage is entirely ignoring the last few years of<em>Assassin\'s Creed</em>\'s own real-world history, though.<em>Mirage</em>\'s protagonist is Basim, a member of the Assassin Brotherhood players first met back in<em>Valhalla</em>. Here, though, we\'re meeting him for the first time  not a seasoned, skilled Hidden One, but a rabble-rousing street rat, adopted into the Brotherhood following a heist gone disastrously wrong and rising through its ranks. Given the younger turn for the character here, Lee Majdoub takes over voicing Basim from<em>Valhalla</em>\'s Carlo Rota, portraying him as an almost Aladdin-esque figure  although this Aladdin is one haunted by visions of jinni, rather than aided by them. Without venturing into spoiler territory, Basim is shaping up to be one of the more important protagonists in the series\' grander continuity, so it\'s fascinating to finally learn his background.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"Assassin\'s Creed Mirage\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/assassins-creed-mirage-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/assassins-creed-mirage-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/assassins-creed-mirage-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/assassins-creed-mirage-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/assassins-creed-mirage-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauehosting.com/empire/2023/10/assassins-creed-mirage-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/assassins-creed-mirage-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Keeping with the renewed focus on stealth, Basim\'s journey brings back an element of investigation too. Key targets need to be identified, tracked down, and flushed out, before you can dispatch them. It\'s here where Baghdad\'s streets come alive, full of people to overhear, trail for info, or pickpocket key items from. It\'s refreshing to once more have to really learn about the setting and its inhabitants to progress, making for a world you\'re far more deeply entrenched in.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>And, for fans who perhaps came onboard with the contemporary trilogy, there are still some RPG elements at work here, too. There\'s a degree of crafting, requiring you to gather upgrade components to enhance weapons, and skill points with which to enhance Basim\'s abilities  albeit with those points awarded from story progression, rather than from gaining experience points.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Basim has a few new tricks up his sleeve too, most notably Assassin\'s Focus. Gained during the course of the key missions, this is similar to marking enemies in past games, but with a follow-on that sees our murderous hero taking out his foes in sequence, a flourish of daggers and blood. It\'s a powerful tool in your arsenal, so it\'s only appropriate that it takes a good while for Basim\'s Focus bar to recharge after you unleash it, but it\'s an awesome addition to the series.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Not all the callbacks or earlier<em>Assassin\'s Creed</em>games are as welcome, though. The series\' parkour navigation now feels slightly stilted, with Basim once again needing exact handholds to clamber up an obstacle. Yes, it\'s a bit more realistic - the Brotherhood trains mortal assassins, not Spider-Verse extras - but it does make for some awkward escapes from well-guarded locations when you get stuck halfway up a wall. And, while<em>Mirage</em>\'s return to stealth is welcome, it brings with it a reduction in Basim\'s arsenal, stripping his weaponry back to dagger and sword. The only ranged attacks are throwing knives, which makes the absence of a bow and arrow keenly felt.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Fittingly, for a series that plays with real world history,<em>Mirage</em>brings together the past and present of<em>Assassin\'s Creed</em>, and makes a case for its future. With far less bloat, and significantly less back-and-forth to pad the play time out, players are reminded what the appeal was in the first place.</p>\n</span>', '2024-03-11 17:43:04', '2024-03-11 17:43:04', 'Assassins Creed Mirage Review', 'https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/assassins-creed-mirage-3.jpg?ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=top&auto=format&w=1440&q=80', 'movies', 'https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/assassins-creed-mirage/', 'Platforms:Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, PC Assassins Creed...', 'gaming'),

The Banished Court, a cult controlled by shady industrialists and demon worshippers, has found the Bright Storm, the source of all magic, with which they could reshape reality itself. Worse, the heroic Lamplighters League, a secret organisation of special agents who once kept the Court at bay, has fallen. The good news, though: theres still a chance to save the world. A new generation of Lamplighters, one formed in desperation out of mercenaries and thieves, may be able to disrupt the Courts operations enough to buy time to disrupt their plans.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Youll do that through a mix of<em>XCOM</em>-style turn-based strategy and real-time exploration &amp; stealth. Its a fascinating mix, and one that, in hindsight, seems bizarre that more games havent experimented with before now, as it works incredibly well. The combination results in massive mission maps that have more to offer than a single, lengthy tactical battle. Instead, you might skulk around to pick up enemy intel or supplies without being seen, dodge enemies to rescue an ally or new agent, or engage in a series of smaller turn-based battles as you make your way across the map, picking off enemies in smaller groups. Each mission eats up a week of in-game time though, so youll need to choose where to deploy and which of the Banished Courts three houses to disrupt carefully  if any one of them achieves their nefarious goals, its game over, for you and the world.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"The Lamplighters League\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/lamplighters-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/lamplighters-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/lamplighters-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/lamplighters-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/lamplighters-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/lamplighters-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/lamplighters-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Set in an alternate 1930s, the influence of pulp adventure novels and movie serials weighs heavily on<em>The Lamplighters League</em>, but filtered through a modern day understanding of that material thats further skewed by the looming presence of the<em>Indiana Jones</em> series. Both feature globe-hopping treks, mystical macguffins to liberate, and plenty of fascists to punch, but<em>Lamplighters</em>does it with an even more roguish flair thanks to its cast of reluctant recruits.

Thankfully though, theyre all given genre- and stereotype-busting twists by developer Harebrained Schemes. While recruitable Lamplighters all fall into one of three classes  melee focused Bruisers, disruptive Saboteurs, and infiltration-oriented Sneaks, each class bolstered by their own way of taking out enemies before getting into a tactical battle  their designs and play styles often defy archetypal convention.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>For instance, while svelte ex(?)-spy Ingrid might, at a glance, be presumed to be a Sneak, shes actually a Bruiser, capable of dishing out huge amounts of damage up close and chaining together final blows that can see her punch out an entire field of enemies. Burly World War I vet Eddie, meanwhile, looks every bit the Bruiser, but is instead a Saboteur with a predilection for guns (hes American), who can keep distant enemies at bay while also being able to pick locks outside of battle. Later characters mix things up further within their classes, such as mind-controlling, poison wielding Clestine, a Sneak whose play style feels completely different to Lateef, the first Sneak youll gather, who emphasises pistol shots and overwatch manoeuvres in combat.

At one point, a turn-based skirmish against a mere two members of the Banished Courts forces escalated into a battle against a dozen when a final blow knocked the last grunt into earshot of his allies, who responded in force. Conversely, mastering the stealth aspects allows you to potentially break up one vast map into a series of smaller battles, whittling enemy numbers down, before dropping into tactical mode for more precise attacks or to handle bigger squads. Similarly, being able to split up your team in real time allows you to tackle objectives freely, such as breaking a Sneak off to clamber up some vines only they can scale to reach a collectible, or having a Bruiser break down a wall to open up new routes for the whole team. Getting to grips with each Lamplighters skills can significantly affect how you progress through each mission  and theres even a touch of low-key deck-building worked in on top, with mystical tarot cards to be equipped to your heroes, adding to or modifying their abilities.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Sadly,<em>The Lamplighters League</em>lacks one key aspect of any great stealth game  the ability to move and hide the bodies of felled foes. It undermines the stealth mechanics when remaining enemies will always be tipped off when they see one of their allies who you so deftly took down, triggering an area-wide alert and a massive confrontation.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Worse, those same massive mission maps that otherwise so impress for their potential for exploration and area control also seem to be too much for the game to actually handle. Pop into Recon Mode, a nifty feature allowing you to scope out the terrain from overhead, and the game absolutely chugs, vomiting frames like one of Clestines poisoned victims. Thats when you can see anything at all though  in turn-based mode, the camera would often position itself behind rocks or walls, blocking the view of important moments. On PC (version tested), the game would also sometimes decide to not recognise controller inputs, forcing an awkward reach for the mouse to click on the icon or object that wasnt responding to button presses, or refusing to actually aim targetable attacks.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>The lack of technical polish is a real shame, as<em>The Lamplighters League</em>is otherwise a fantastic evolution of the turn-based strategy genre. It weaves a gloriously pulpy adventure with high stakes and higher thrills, all elevated by great voice acting and rousing music throughout. Hopefully, performance can be improved through post-release patches, as the constant bugs take the gleam off what could be a real gem.</p>\n</span>', '2024-03-11 17:43:04', '2024-03-11 17:43:04', 'The Lamplighters League Review', 'https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/10/lamplighters-1.jpg?ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=top&auto=format&w=1440&q=80', 'movies', 'https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/the-lamplighters-league/', 'Platforms:PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One Heres the bad news: youve...', 'gaming'),

Now, as a strangely beauteous version of Pinocchio, you\'re the only one capable of navigating Krat\'s streets, defeating puppets gripped by a violent frenzy, and seeking out your creator in hopes of restoring order.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"Lies of P\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/09/Lies_of_P__Neowiz_Carcass.png?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/09/Lies_of_P__Neowiz_Carcass.png?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/09/Lies_of_P__Neowiz_Carcass.png?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/09/Lies_of_P__Neowiz_Carcass.png?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/09/Lies_of_P__Neowiz_Carcass.png?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/09/Lies_of_P__Neowiz_Carcass.png?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/09/Lies_of_P__Neowiz_Carcass.png?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>As a soulsborne, <em>Lies of P</em> doesn\'t do much to rock the boat, its lineage directly traceable back to the earliest examples of the genre. A rare form of energy called Ergo is gathered from defeated foes, spent to level up Pinocchio\'s skills, but lost if defeated before using it. Common enemies respawn whenever you use a Stargazer, this game\'s equivalent of bonfires in <em>Souls</em>, and shortcuts can be created by working your way around each fixed area to open a gate or lower a ladder. So far, so <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Where <em>Lies of P</em> begins to carve out more of an identity for itself is in its combat. It\'s familiar enough to dive right into for soulsborne fans  attacks mapped to shoulder buttons, a lock-on and dodge system, all the old favourites  but pretty quickly reveals its unique tweaks. A lot of this comes from its sword-based weapon customisation, where Pinocchio can disassemble and recombine the blades and hilts of different weapons into one with the best attributes of both. For instance, the powerful but slow blade of a greatsword can be joined with a rapier\'s handle, gaining a notable speed boost without losing much power. In truth, there\'s not a great variety of base weapons, but there\'s considerable flexibility in how you rebuild them. Weapons can also be elementally charged, adding an electric or fire effect to better target enemy weaknesses.</p>\n</span><div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__ynq1g\" data-test=\"pullquote\">\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__icon__JGpkh\"><span></span></div>\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__content__gRuai\">\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Delectably gothic and stylish, Lies of P is one of the best new entries in the genre in years.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>The one aspect of this already mostly human-looking Pinocchio that highlights his artificial origins is his left arm, which serves as another weapon. Dubbed a Legion Arm, this is another customisable tool, swappable at Stargazers, each one having a particular skill. The Legion Arm is another nice way to switch things up depending on either your personal play style  for instance, players who prefer to keep their distance may enjoy the Puppet String arm, allowing you to yank a single enemy towards you  or tailor the loadout to better target specific enemies, such as with the Fulminis arm: basically a flamethrower with fingers.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Unlike many other soulsborne games though, there\'s a far more direct story to follow here, which may win over players who find themselves lost by the light dustings of lore scattered over FromSoftware\'s better-known titles. It\'s far from a beat-for-beat adaptation of Collodi\'s work, more a collection of allusions and grim twists on familiar moments, but it\'s enough to draw you through the game with purpose. Collodi\'s characters are also massaged into <em>Lies of P</em> in surprisingly elegant fashion, from the Blue Fairy serving as a mysterious figure named Sophia, the Talking Cricket as a guide called Gemini (pronounced \"Jeminy\", a nod to the Disney version), while the Fox and the Cat here are humans wearing animal masks, members of a group called Stalkers who hunt down the rogue puppets plaguing Krat. Combined, it all creates a wonderfully dark and alluring aesthetic.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Of course, what\'s a <em>Pinocchio</em> tale without the boy\'s penchant for telling fibs? Lies play a major role here  it\'s in the name, after all  with Pinocchio faced with the decision to tell the truth or lie at key points. This forms the basis of a loose morality system, and although, in the moment, it seems designed more to force the player to make uncomfortable choices (such as whether to tell a grieving mother that her baby is in fact a doll), the amount of lies told factors into the game\'s branching endings.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>There are frustrations, though, and not the \'good\' kind of frustrations inherent to the soulsborne genre that usually beckon you to try, try, try again. The combat simply isn\'t as polished as it could be, with odd hitboxes meaning your strikes mightnot connect, or worse, you\'ll be tagged by enemy attacks you think you\'ve successfully dodged. Pinocchio\'s sometimes sluggish dodging can be improved by appropriately upgrading his P-Organ (no giggling  it\'s another way to modify his skills), but evasion never feels as smooth or reliable as it should. And, with swords being the de facto weapon, Pinocchio\'s range is relatively fixed, leaving precious few ways to counter enemies brandishing ranged attacks or much longer weapons.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Most annoying, though, is the difficulty curve  while the entire soulsborne genre thrives on challenge, <em>Lies of P</em> is ludicrously tough early on. It also commits a cardinal sin by arbitrarily blocking off levelling up without explanation in its prologue, before most abilities are available and ahead of a thunderously tough first boss. This doesn\'t so much entice players to force their way through to see what awaits, as it does potentially drive them to put the controller down and never pick it up again.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Still, for those who do power through, this unlikely take on <em>Pinocchio</em> ultimately proves a captivating fable. Delectably gothic and stylish, <em>Lies of P</em> is one of the best new entries in the genre in years, and that\'s the truth.</p>\n</span>', '2024-03-11 17:43:04', '2024-03-11 17:43:04', 'Lies Of P Review', 'https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/09/Lies_of_P__Neowiz_Scrapped_Watchman.png?ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=top&auto=format&w=1440&q=80', 'movies', 'https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/lies-of-p/', 'Platforms: Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, PC, Mac Theres always...', 'gaming');

(268, NULL, '<p>Eleanor Cardwell says Tracey Neville was \"huge\" in making her the goal shooter she has become, as she reveals the Melbourne Mavericks coach\'s influence on the career she has had so far and her remarkable change from a defender to an attacker on the court. </p>\n<p>Cardwell had an established career in the Netball Super League with Manchester Thunder and Severn Stars before making the move to Australia in 2023 with Adelaide Thunderbirds.</p>\n\n<p>After winning a premiership title in her first season, she joined her former Thunderbirds assistant coach Tracey Neville at the Melbourne Mavericks ahead of the club\'s inaugural season in the Suncorp Super Netball league. The Mavericks hold the licence which was made vacant by the Collingwood Magpies.</p>\n\n<p>Cardwell, in the third episode of <em>Sky Sports Netball: Off The Court </em>podcast, discussed her move to the Mavericks after a single season with the Thunderbirds.</p>\n<p>She revealed her short time with the Thunderbirds was not planned, but the opportunity to be under the guidance of Neville as head coach again was too good an opportunity to turn down.</p>    \n<p>\"At the end of the season I didn\'t think I was going to move,\" said Cardwell.</p>\n\n<p>\"I loved Adelaide, I loved everything about it. I said that to all the girls, I didn\'t think I was going to move [and] told the club I didn\'t think I was going to move. They have an incredible environment and obviously winning was better.</p>\n\n<p>\"Then I heard the news about Tracey which was incredible and then had a phone call with her and was like, \'oh I wonder if she\'ll want me in her team?\' Like I\'ve been with her for 12 years, I wonder if she\'s got me in her brain? But then I got a phone call and she was like, \'El obviously I want you in my team\'.</p>\n<p>\"So it gave me something to think about and last time she followed me to Adelaide.</p>\n<p>\"I love learning, if I\'m not learning I wouldn\'t be playing netball. I wouldn\'t want to be doing anything where I\'m not learning. I know that every single year I\'ve been with Tracey, I\'ve learnt something new, and I have for so many years. I\'m constantly learning, it\'s crazy how much you can learn from her.\"</p>        \n<p>Neville was Cardwell\'s coach at Manchester Thunder from 2013, before becoming her national coach after taking the England Roses job in 2015.</p>\n<p>When Cardwell began at Thunder she was initially used as a defender, but started transitioning to a goal shooter, admitting she was originally unsure of her capabilities as an attacker.</p>\n<p>But with the guidance of Neville, Karen Greig and also Roses team-mate George Fisher, Cardwell began to understand the position and grew her confidence and ability for the role.</p>\n<p>\"I was only ever a defender, played goalkeeper, goal defence, wing defence, only ever a defender. I was always the player who everyone wanted me on their team for the warm-up game because I could defend, but I could also shoot,\" said Cardwell.</p>\n<p>\"I was really filling in in 2014, I was filling in at centre in training. I wasn\'t getting any court time, Tracey shouting at me for not being able to deliver first phase and I was like this is not my style, being really hesitant on the ball, but then I popped in at goal attack in that training session.</p>\n<p>\"Once it happened everyone was like \'El, why are you not in this position?\' This is your calling and I was like \'guys I\'m a defender through and through, I\'m never ever becoming a shooter don\'t make me laugh\'.</p>\n<p>\"But then the next morning Tracey was like \'El, I\'ve been up all night I just think this is what we need to do. If you want to develop and you want to become a netballer and if you want to play for England, you need to become a shooter and I think you can really do it with a lot of training\'.</p>\n<p>\"\'It\'s going to be hard work, but you need to make the decision right now if you want to do it\'. Then I was like \'right well ok, let\'s throw myself in\'.</p>\n<p>\"I remember going to an U16,U17 camp [and] George Fisher was there, the big shooting star. George was trying to show me what to do, she was showing all the examples. [I was] falling all over the place, it was embarrassing.</p>\n<p>\"Tracey was a huge rock around that time, really stripped me back and taught me the ropes and Karen as well. It was thanks to those two, I wouldn\'t be sat here today without both of them.\"</p>\n<h3>Glasgow doing \'really well\'</h3>         \n<p>Cardwell also gave an update on England and Mavericks team-mate Sasha Glasgow, who suffered a broken tibia and fibula in the second quarter of a practice match against Sunshine Coast Lightning in February.</p>\n<p>\"I mean it was pretty traumatic for everyone, especially Sasha,\" said Cardwell.</p>\n<p>\"She\'s doing great, she\'s living with me at the minute. She\'s doing really well, I\'m actually really proud of how she\'s doing.</p>\n<p>\"Her leg looks so much better in one week, it\'s crazy how well it\'s doing. Last night she put some weight down on it for the first time, which is a huge milestone and that\'s only a week.</p>\n<p>\"It\'s incredible what she\'s doing, she\'s been a super trooper, big fighter. Obviously this is really hard for her, and all the girls have come together really well especially for a new team.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Watch the Netball Super League throughout the season live on Sky Sports and the Sky Sports YouTube channel.

Darts is lucky to have him as as their world champion, as their world No 1, because he does a lot right. He looks great, there\'s no negatives with Luke and my word, he can play and he makes the game look so simple at times.\"</p>\n<h3><strong>Time for Litter to start winning? </strong></h3>\n<p>Luke Littler remains inside the top-four of the season-long standings after reaching the semi-finals on Night Six, although the 17-year-old experienced struggles with his finishing as his wait for a night victory continues.</p>\n<p>Littler missed 14 out of 20 attempts at double during his quarter-final victory over Nathan Aspinall, then only converted three out of his 15 checkout opportunities during a 6-3 loss against Michael Smith.</p>         \n<p>\"We [Littler] expect amazing things when he steps on stage,\" Mardle added. \"Apart from Humphries in the Premier League, I know Van Gerwen has been getting the wins, but numbers-wise the statistics suggest he\'s playing some of the best darts.</p>\n<p>\"The way that he\'s scoring, he\'s right up there with what anyone\'s doing in the Premier League. The finishing is not great, so there\'s improvement to be made, but he needs to start getting wins though.</p>         \n<p>\"He played great in the UK Open, but didn\'t win.

In fact, some are convinced that certain Stratagems might not even be on our side.</p>\n\n<p>If you\'re new to Helldivers 2, Stratagems are crucial. They can be called in by putting in a series of directional inputs, and offer a wide range of help in the form of extra ammo, different weapons, enormous orbital strikes on foes, automatic turrets, and more. However, in a shooter where friendly fire is always on, keeping your teammates out of your own firing line is key, and some believe that specific Stratagems have genuine bloodlust and a thirst for violence against Helldivers.</p>\n<p>One of these is the Mortar Sentry, which in theory, is supposed to provide backup by firing at enemies, which is perfect for keeping areas under control. However, many on Reddit have found that their turrets seem to focus way more on themselves and their team than the threats they\'re actually supposed to be fighting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"That thing deliberately shoots at you without a doubt in my mind. Closest enemy was about 30m away and the mortar just shoots three at me and one at the enemy,\" one player <u>wrote</u>, recalling the tragic betrayal they experienced.</p>\n\n<p>\"It doesn\'t help that the mortar sentry seems to have a SEVERAL FOOT MARGIN OF ERROR. I\'ve kept the bugs off me, been completely clear, and STILL been hit by a mortar trying to hit a bug on the opposite side of a rock from me &#8211; at least five feet away. The only way to avoid death from the friendly mortar sentry is to be outside its firing range,\" <u>added</u> another.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>Similar issues have been noted with the deadly Orbital 380MM HE Barrage, which is so unpredictable that one player on Reddit is convinced it\'s manned by an automaton. Although its fantastic power can be incredible when it lands on the intended target, its missiles often go astray with disastrous consequences for the Helldivers on the ground.&#160;</p>\n<p>\"I\'ve been running the last several games and purely based off my anecdotal evidence I am firmly under the impression that the 380MM cannon gunner is, in fact, an automaton,\" the user <u>wrote</u>.&#160;</p>\n<p>\"380 barrage is the worst [...]. I think I&#8217;ve been blown up by my own barrage more times than I\'ve killed things,\" another <u>agreed</u>.</p>\n<p>Of course, both these Stratagems can still be great, and they\'re always going to be more useful in certain situations than others.

It only started rolling out in the UK in December of 2023, and in a big plot twist, it\'s already seen a &#163;500 price cut. That brings the POX down to <strong>&#163;3,299 at Currys</strong>, which is pretty ludicrous for a brand new RTX 4080 gaming PC that\'s powered by an Intel Core i9 processor.&#160;</p>\n<p>Now, I won\'t lie to you - this is still a very expensive gaming PC. If you\'re shopping for specs like these, you\'re going to need to part with a lot of coin first.

Their motherboards can have quirks to make up for their smaller size, and they can prove difficult to cool because their cases pack everything so closely together.&#160;</p>\n<p>Acer, however, crafted something truly innovative with the Orion X, and it somehow managed to sneak a water cooler into a tiny case that could already squeeze the biggest size of graphics card inside it.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>Before I tell you more about why this PC jumped straight to our UK gaming PC top spot, here are the important parts of the deal.</p>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BjCSG9YwcMHuVFYBMohzGW-200-100.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" title=\"Image\" class=\"hawk-lazy-image-deal-widget\" draggable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"140\" height=\"160\">\n<p><strong>Acer Predator Orion X</strong> | <del>&#163;3,799</del> <strong>&#163;3,299 at Currys</strong><br><em><strong>Save &#163;500</strong></em> - The POX-950 is currently the only available configuration, and it comprises an RTX 4080, Unlocked Intel Core i9-13900KS, 32GB of DDR5, and 2TB of SSD storage with plenty of room for more, should you need it.

As I said in my review of this machine, there\'s very little you can throw an i9 and a 4080 at and be disappointed. I spent plenty of time gaming on this PC, but I also did a fair bit of content creation with it as well, editing an entire video for my YouTube channel, and the Orion X made it all as speedy and easy as possible.&#160;</p>\n<p>Playing games in exclusively 4K admittedly trounced the admirable frame rates of my own machine, and despite slower-than-expected SSD speeds, there wasn\'t much to fault here. Everything, especially its cooling, was a vast improvement over the last Acer gaming PC I tested. The Acer Predator Orion 7000 (2023) refreshed its motherboard for the DDR5 generation, but its BIOS was extremely prohibitive and didn\'t let you change timings or access XMP. Similarly, its reliance on air cooling only couldn\'t keep up with its new 13th generation i9 processor, which frequently reached boiling point when I benchmarked it. The noise from its fans was pretty unruly as well.&#160;</p>\n<p>The Orion X improved on all of those things - XMP was easily accessible in the BIOS, temperatures remained under control, and even when using the Turbo settings, the noise was kept to an absolute low.&#160;</p>\n<p>The price of this little PC is considerably lower than the larger Orion 7000, which is surprising in my opinion. According to our recorded benchmarks, and from my experience, the Orion X is a much, much better gaming PC. While it is still over &#163;3,000 in this deal at Currys, I\'d say it\'s worth buying because of that fact alone - this is already great value when you pit it against similar brands like Asus or compare it to the prices of the best Alienware gaming PCs.&#160;</p>\n<p>For a brand new rig like this to drop by &#163;500 for no real occasion, it makes it very worth buying.</p>\n\nToday\'s best gaming PC deals\n\n\n<img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31Fd2SF6olL._SL500_.jpg\" alt=\"OMEN 30L by HP GT13-1154 -...\" title=\"OMEN 30L by HP GT13-1154 -...\" class=\"hawk-lazy-image-product-image\" draggable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"78\" height=\"70\">\nHP OMEN 30L\n<img src=\"https://mos.fie.futurecdn.net/logos/merchants/kg7rxut4dskeqa3e-15622498507436-100-80.png\" alt=\"Walmart\" title=\"Walmart\" class=\"hawk-lazy-image-logo-image\" draggable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"80\" height=\"40\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hawk-display-price-price\">$2,449.99</span><span class=\"hawk-display-price-price\">$1,529.99</span>\n\nView Deal\n\n<span>See all prices</span>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://mos.fie.futurecdn.net/hm9kz3joszhiwnlx-16910736148638-100-80.png\" alt=\"Alienware Aurora R16\" title=\"Alienware Aurora R16\" class=\"hawk-lazy-image-product-image\" draggable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"78\" height=\"70\">\nAlienware Aurora R16\n<img src=\"https://mos.fie.futurecdn.net/dtjgztywpah612bk-16685390008939-100-80.png\" alt=\"Dell\" title=\"Dell\" class=\"hawk-lazy-image-logo-image\" draggable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"80\" height=\"40\">\n\n<span class=\"hawk-display-price-price\">$1,749.99</span>\nView Deal\n\n<span>See all prices</span>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/21n-8HlAzDL._SL500_.jpg\" alt=\"Acer - Predator Orion 7000...\" title=\"Acer - Predator Orion 7000...\" class=\"hawk-lazy-image-product-image\" draggable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"78\" height=\"70\">\nAcer Predator Orion 7000\n<img src=\"https://mos.fie.futurecdn.net/logos/merchants/ns2bwjiwdvqv2pfx-16049184768113-100-80.png\" alt=\"Best Buy\" title=\"Best Buy\" class=\"hawk-lazy-image-logo-image\" draggable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"80\" height=\"40\">\n\n<span class=\"hawk-display-price-price\">$4,499.99</span>\nView Deal\n\n<span>See all prices</span>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://mos.fie.futurecdn.net/products/2d1e80465f5039325b36e89ca53e88a6cda6ae59-100-80.jpg\" alt=\"Acer Predator Orion 7000...\" title=\"Acer Predator Orion 7000...\" class=\"hawk-lazy-image-product-image\" draggable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"78\" height=\"70\">\nAcer Predator Orion 7000 PO7-650\n<img src=\"https://mos.fie.futurecdn.net/logos/merchants/amazon-us-15006529670367-100-80.png\" alt=\"Amazon\" title=\"Amazon\" class=\"hawk-lazy-image-logo-image\" draggable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"80\" height=\"40\">\n\n<span class=\"hawk-display-price-price\">$2,912.49</span>\nView Deal\n\n<span>See all prices</span>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41ovDf0K24L._SL500_.jpg\" alt=\"CyberpowerPC Gamer Xtreme VR...\" title=\"CyberpowerPC Gamer Xtreme VR...\" class=\"hawk-lazy-image-product-image\" draggable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"78\" height=\"70\">\nCyberPowerPC Gamer Extreme VR\n<img src=\"https://mos.fie.futurecdn.net/logos/merchants/amazon-us-15006529670367-100-80.png\" alt=\"Amazon\" title=\"Amazon\" class=\"hawk-lazy-image-logo-image\" draggable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"80\" height=\"40\">\n\n<span class=\"hawk-display-price-price\">$1,119</span>\nView Deal\n\n<span>See all prices</span>\n\n\n\nWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n\n\n<hr>\n<p><em>Looking for PC parts instead of a full machine?

Yoshida has been directing Final Fantasy 14 for over a decade now, and despite being at the forefront of 2023\'s Final Fantasy 16, he didn\'t direct the most recent entry in the RPG series.</p>\n<p>Yoshida answered plainly, saying that, while it\'s completely undecided right now, if the chance came about to work on another large-scale project, he\'d like to direct it himself. Shimoda is intrigued by this, and asks Yoshida how the timing for this project could potentially come about, given that Yoshida\'s into the twilight of his career at over 50 years old.</p>\n\n\n<p>The Final Fantasy 14 director says he\'s considered directing one more game before passing the baton on to the next generation of game developers. However, Yoshida says this mindset would actually trap and somewhat limit him, effectively providing him with a ceiling that he couldn\'t exceed.</p>\n\n<p>Yoshida then says company employees, such as developers, follow the thinking of their higher-ups. If Yoshida were to direct one last game, he would be in this position, and so those underneath him would regard the project as \"Yoshida\'s masterpiece\" or something similar, which wouldn\'t be a good look.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>The Final Fantasy 14 lead then turns to a snowboarding metaphor. Despite being in his 50s, Yoshida still loves snowboarding and feels like he gets better at the sport every time he snowboards. He\'s sort of taking this attitude with game development - he wants to keep improving his own craft because he feels like he\'s capable of more.</p>\n<p>Final Fantasy 14 is speeding towards Dawntrail, the MMO\'s next major expansion, which is set to launch later this year in summer. You can read our very own new Final Fantasy 14 interview with Yoshida for comments on how the last 10 years of the MMO will inform the next decade.&#160;</p>\n<p><em>Final Fantasy 14\'s next 14-hour livestream</em><em> is set to take place next month on April 12, and it\'ll feature game leads like Yoshida.&#160;</em></p>', '2024-03-12 03:00:01', '2024-03-12 03:00:01', 'Final Fantasy 14\'s Yoshi-P would like to direct another \"major\" game before he retires', 'https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SmMtXnNiYMK4ES3gtZA3Tf.png', 'games', 'https://www.gamesradar.com/final-fantasy-14s-yoshi-p-would-like-to-direct-another-major-game-before-he-retires/', 'Final Fantasy 14 director Naoki Yoshida has addressed whether he\'ll direct anoth...', ''),

If you\'ve already played Insomniac\'s most recent title, you\'re probably all too familiar with how much sand gets sent flying around when going up against the Marvel villain.

At the highest Helldivers 2 difficulties, players kick others if they aren\'t using a few weapons, such as the Breaker shotgun or the Railgun Stratagem. Helldivers 2\'s first balance patch last week attempted to knock both weapons off their pedestals, but apparently, it\'s been to little effect.</p>\n<p>Now, Helldivers 2 game director Johan Pilestedt has turned to the game\'s player base to try and remedy the kicking issue.

While this might be a bit worrisome for anyone concerned about spending hours trekking through a boring expanse of space, the devs tease that Dragon\'s Dogma 2\'s world has been made to be \"so enjoyable\" that, in theory, we won\'t want to rush through things.</p>\n<p>In an <u>interview with Automaton</u>, game director Hideaki Itsuno acknowledges that many want to see transportation methods such as horses added to open-world games, but he believes this is because the world itself can often feel dull without it. In Dragon\'s Dogma 2, the goal was to make it so that \"it would actually be a shame to ride a horse,\" the director shares.&#160;</p>\n\n\n<p>\"Our goal was to prepare a path so enjoyable that players would not feel the need for a horse,\" Itsuno explains. \"We have built in a lot of \'fun\' into the map so that players will not get bored along the way, and our development policy was to make it so that it would actually be a shame to ride a horse.\"</p>\n\n<p>Producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi elaborates on this when justifying why the fast-travel system, which utilizes rare items known as Ferrystones, was purposely made to be restricted, rather than allowing us to zip across the map freely whenever we please.</p>\n\n<p>\"I think that in games that employ fast travel without restrictions, the emphasis is on the content in between traveling, but in Dragon\'s Dogma 2, the emphasis is also on the experience of travel itself,\" Hirabayashi says. \"For example, nighttime is very dangerous due to limited visibility, and the fear of the night gives distances a meaning. If you are going to spend the night traveling to a distant destination, you need to make sure to bring enough oil for your lanterns before you leave your base. You need to think about whether you should bring camping gear and make necessary preparations. Our goal was to create a rhythm of tension and relaxation.\"</p>\n<p>Itsuno adds that traveling on foot \"makes it possible to experience new developments or discover alternate routes\" and notes that \"just the act of traveling can create drama.\" He added, \"You can feel a sense of adventure, and I think that each user will be able to experience something different even on the same road.\"</p>\n<p>Dragon\'s Dogma 2 is set to launch on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on March 22.

(308, NULL, '<p>A series that started with a heist in Hyderabad ended with a drubbing in Dharamsala.</p>\n<p>The final Test, staged in the foothills of the Himalayas, seemed a trek too far for England as Ben Stokes\' tourists were trounced by in an innings inside three days and slumped to a 4-1 defeat.</p>\n\n<p>England failed to lay a glove on India once they plummeted from 100-1 to 218 all out in their first innings, in contrast to the previous four games in which they were highly competitive.</p>\n\n\n<p>Highly competitive - but ultimately lacking in the big moments, save for their comeback from a deficit of 190 runs on first innings in the opening Test as they secured one of their greatest overseas wins.</p>\n<p>England had chances in the next three matches, they were sometimes on top, then faded as catches went down, wickets were gifted, Bazball malfunctioned, and India\'s might on home soil told.</p>    \n<p>As the dust settles on a series of missed opportunities for England, we look at some of the decisions they must make before they are next in Test action against West Indies in July, live on <em>Sky Sports</em>.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Bin off Bazball?</strong></h3>\n<p>Bazball - the word we just cannot leave alone. England dislike it and it is getting a bit boring writing it but it has come to define this team.</p>\n\n<p>Used as a positive when they win - as they did in 10 of the first 11 Tests under Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes after a painful run of one victory in 17 before that - and used as a stick to beat them with when they lose - as they have done in seven of their 12 games since that near flawless start in the hedonistic summer of 2022.</p>         \n<p>The term, in its most basic form, means taking the positive option, something McCullum, Stokes and their players have stressed does not always equate to belting sixes and fours but by putting the opposition under pressure.</p>\n<p>Bazball is a mindset, not an order. It is up the batters at the crease to take responsibility, something Ben Duckett and Ollie Pope perhaps did not do in the Dharamsala defeat.</p>\n<p>Duckett spooned to cover in the first innings and was bowled on the charge in the second, while Pope was limply stumped on the stroke of lunch first time around and caught on the sweep on the final day as his series petered out after a stunning 196 in Hyderabad.</p>\n<p>Joe Root may also still be ruing his ill-timed reverse scoop in the third Test at Rajkot, which triggered a collapse of 8-95 when England had the game by the scruff of the neck and India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin was absent for personal reasons.</p>         \n<p>Speaking on the <em>Sky Sports Cricket Podcast</em>, Michael Atherton said: \"The team is in a far better state than it was when McCullum and Stokes took over and I would not like to see England go back to the timidity that we saw before, no retrenchment.</p>\n<p>\"But there have been times against Australia and India where they have not been smart enough, or good enough, or hard enough, to take advantage of winning positions.\"</p>\n<p>McCullum says there will be \"refinement\" to the model, which could be code for more judicious strokeplay, but also felt his team were too \"timid\" at times against India, so don\'t expect Bazball to be dispensed with entirely.</p>\n<p>Considering the success it has brought and the shot in the arm it has given English Test cricket, that is probably wise. It\'s time for evolution, not revolution.</p>\n<p>What England fans may want to hear less of, though, is the grating rhetoric, such as when Duckett replied \"the more the better\" when asked what his team could realistically chase in the fourth innings in Rajkot. Less waffle, more wins is what supporters will be after.</p> \n<h3><strong>Bairstow, Foakes, both or neither?</strong></h3>\n<p>While Bazball is named after McCullum and been ingrained into the side by Stokes, it was Jonny Bairstow who lived it to the fullest two years ago, scoring four centuries in six Tests at a strike rate of 96.59, truly kicking off the new era with a 77-ball hundred during a post-tea onslaught against New Zealand at Trent Bridge.</p>\n<p>The Yorkshireman suffered a horrific leg break later that summer and has not been able to scale those heights since, averaging 28.87 across his last nine Tests with two half-centuries. Bairstow reached double figures eight times out of 10 in India this winter but never made it past 39.</p>\n<p>With Harry Brook, who missed the subcontinental tour for personal reasons, to return the middle order at some stage, Bairstow\'s spot looks vulnerable, unless he takes back the wicketkeeping gloves from Ben Foakes, as he did ahead of last summer\'s Ashes series.</p>\n<p>Foakes was silky behind the stumps in India - when is he anything but? - yet was unable to truly impose himself with the bat, although he was often left operating with the tail such was the brittleness of England\'s middle order as collapse followed collapse and 400 was only breached once.</p> \n<p>Bairstow\'s more bombastic batting - Foakes has readily admitted he is not what you would call Bazball - could tempt England into picking him as wicketkeeper ahead of the steadier Foakes - or they could say sayonara to them both and pump for someone in the next generation of glovemen.</p>\n<p>Somerset\'s James Rew, 20, perhaps heads that group, after averaging 57 in County Championship Division One in 2023 with five hundreds, but Surrey\'s Jamie Smith, 23, is also an option His issue, though, may be that Foakes is likely to keep for his county.</p>\n<p>What\'s becoming clear is that there is probably not room for both Bairstow and Foakes in the same England side, not unless Baz and Ben have concerns over vice-captain Pope at No 3.</p>\n<p>Pope made a divine intervention in Hyderabad with that sweep-laden century but has been febrile at the crease and short of runs either side of that, while he has been dismissed for less than 20 in more than half of his 77 innings in Test cricket.</p> \n<h3><strong>What to do with the bowlers?</strong></h3>\n<p>As much as England\'s Test cricket has changed over the last two years - so much of it for the better, let\'s not forget - some things have remained the same, namely James Anderson taking wickets.</p>\n<p>Test cricket\'s most prolific seamer hit a new high on Saturday, becoming the first fast bowler to 700 scalps and shows no signs of slowing down, despite the fact he will turn 42 in July.</p>\n<p>England must do succession planning for when Anderson is no longer around but that is hard when he keeps succeeding and you sense he will be a key cog in the attack against West Indies and Sri Lanka in the summer and possibly Pakistan and New Zealand next winter as well.</p>         \n<p>We might not be able to say the same about Ollie Robinson with the seamer highly ineffectual in his sole outing in India as fitness and conditioning issues continue to hold back a bowler with an immense upside - height, accuracy, the ability to move the ball both ways.</p>\n<p>With Stuart Broad\'s retirement post-Ashes, there is an opening in the England bowling line-up on home soil and Robinson will feel he can seize it if he can get plenty of county cricket under his belt for Sussex between the season starting in April and the first Test against West Indies.</p>\n<p>If he cannot, however, then you are probably looking at Matthew Potts, Josh Tongue and Gus Atkinson as the men to support Anderson, Mark Wood, Chris Woakes - the latter is likely to be involved in England taking into account his home Test bowling average of 21.88 - and hopefully Stokes, with the skipper eyeing full all-rounder status once again after knee surgery.</p>         \n<p>England also have a decision to make over their No 1 spinner.</p>\n<p>Jack Leach is favourite, and a Stokes favourite, but injuries continue to strike the likeable left-armer, with a stress fracture of the back seeing him miss the Ashes and a knee knock forcing him to return home from India after one Test.</p>\n<p>Off-spinner Shoaib Bashir, 20, and Leach\'s fellow left-armer Tom Hartley, 24, staked their claims in India, with Hartley taking a seven-for on debut and claiming 22 wickets in the series.</p> \n<p>But Bashir, whose guile and change of pace helped him to 17 wickets, is seen as having the higher ceiling and Atherton thinks he could be the one - if he can play domestically that is, with Leach currently ahead of him in the pecking order at Somerset and a two-spinner attack unlikely early season.

(309, NULL, '<p>With Red Bull dominating on track and making unwanted headlines off it, British teenager Oliver Bearman provided Formula 1 with a much-needed feel-good story as he stole the show at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.</p>\n<p>Bearman\'s sudden step up into the most desired seat in motor racing at the age of just 18 came as a result of someone else not feeling so good, with Carlos Sainz needing surgery for appendicitis on Friday.</p>\n\n<p>Just a few hours before final practice, Bearman was informed he would get the opportunity to become the third youngest driver to feature in an F1 race.</p>\n\n<p>The Ferrari Driver Academy product made a solid fist of qualifying, narrowly missing out on a place in Q3 to Lewis Hamilton as he took earned 11th on the grid.</p>\n<p>The Essex-born driver, however, would more crucially get the better of Hamilton on Saturday in Jeddah, making light work of one of the most challenging tracks on the F1 calendar to finish seventh at the end of a demanding 50-lap contest.</p>    \n        \n<p>Yes, Ferrari had a good car, as Charles Leclerc proved by qualifying second and taking the final spot on the podium behind reigning world champion Max Verstappen and his Red Bull team-mate Sergio Perez, but many things could have gone wrong.</p>\n\n<p>As it was, Bearman showed a calmness defying his age and inexperience to hold off the charge of two of Britain\'s biggest stars in Lando Norris and Hamilton in the closing stages.</p>\n\n \n<h3>Bearman: It was over too quickly</h3>\n<p>Bearman\'s remarkable maturity shone through as he dealt with a significantly larger set of media duties than he has ever been exposed to before following the race.</p>\n<p>\"Honestly it didn\'t (feel like a dream), sorry to let you guys down,\" he told <em>Sky Sports F1</em>.</p>\n<p>\"It was a great race and I loved every moment but the weekend was too short.</p>\n<p>\"It was over too quickly and I am now back down to earth and back down to reality but I think I did a good job out there today.\"</p>         \n<p>Bearman had begun his weekend in Saudi Arabia driving in Formula 2, and had taken pole in qualifying for the feeder series feature race on Thursday before being called up by Ferrari.</p>\n<p>\"I don\'t even know what happened in the race,\" he reflected. \"It\'s weird to not watch an F1 race. It\'s probably the first one race I haven\'t watched for a long time. So I\'ll have to go over it when I\'m back home.\"</p>\n<p>Also strange for the youngster was the experience of sharing the track with Hamilton, who made his F1 debut when Bearman was just a one-year-old.</p>\n<p>\"I am quite young,\" he said. \"So that\'s cool.</p>\n<p>\"I grew up watching these guys fighting and it was nice to, I didn\'t fight with them, but nice to share the track with them. It was a pleasure to have their recognition.\"</p>         \n<p>Pushed on what it was like to beat seven-time world champion Hamilton, who will join Ferrari next year, Bearman was extremely modest.</p>\n<p>\"We also had a faster car, so that helps,\" he said. \"The car was flying today, so that obviously a big bonus.</p>\n<p>\"But I think we executed a clean race, no mistakes and that\'s exactly what we were looking for, so I\'m happy with my performance.\"</p>\n<h3>Hamilton leads praise from F1 stars</h3>\n<p>As had been the case after Bearman\'s display on Friday, significant praise came from the sport\'s biggest names.</p>\n<p>Hamilton, who was on hand to applaud and give Bearman a hug as he got out of his car at the end of the race, was effusive in his praise.</p>\n<p>\"I think the Ferrari, firstly, is looking very strong, obviously the closest to the Red Bulls,\" the Mercedes driver said.</p>\n<p>\"But to be pulled out of your class and put straight into a Ferrari, a top team, and have to go straight into practice without long runs and all those sort of things, I think he did such a phenomenal job this weekend and it just shows that he\'s really a bright future star.\"</p>         \n<p>Leclerc, known for his daring approach to racing, was even wowed by Bearman\'s instant fearlessness.</p>\n<p>\"Amazing, amazing. I think everybody has seen how talented he is,\" Leclerc said.</p>\n<p>\"He has been incredible. I remember on Friday watching the first three laps of Ollie in the garage and I was like, \'oh my god\'. He was very close to the walls and pushing like crazy and he has been at ease with the car from the beginning.</p>\n<p>\"He has done an incredible job and he should be extremely proud of himself. To score points in his first F1 race, starting 11 and gaining positions is a huge effort.</p>\n<p>\"So congratulations to him, he has got a bright future ahead of him and he should get a chance in Formula 1 as soon as possible.\"</p>         \n<p>Another of Britain\'s core of F1 stars, George Russell, is also expecting to be competing against Bearman again before long.</p>\n<p>\"Amazing job. I think for anybody coming in, to jump in the car P3 on a circuit like this, really challenging, I\'m really impressed,\" the Mercedes driver said.</p>\n<p>\"I haven\'t followed his career too much in all honesty, a little bit last year in F2, but I remember watching his laps in Mexico last year for Haas and I was impressed with how he was driving.</p>\n<p>\"To come straight out of the box this weekend was a really impressive job. I expect to see him on the grid next year or the year after.\"</p>\n<h3>Ferrari boss Vasseur\'s expectations exceeded</h3>\n<p>While impressing other drivers is important, to achieve his desire of getting a permanent F1 seat, the most important eyes on Bearman in Jeddah were those of the team bosses.</p>\n<p>For Bearman\'s development, the most crucial individual is Ferrari team principal Frederic Vasseur, who could potentially influence another team to take on the 18-year-old in the short term.</p>\n<p>\"Yes (he exceeded my expectations),\" Vasseur told <em>Sky Sports F1</em>. \"I didn\'t have a plan before as you can imagine when I asked Ollie to jump into the car on Friday.</p>\n<p>\"He did very well yesterday, taking it step by step in practice then a very strong qualifying because he missed Q3 by a couple of hundredths.</p>         \n<p>\"Today I was a bit scared because of the start and the pit stops but he was very solid and he didn\'t do a single mistake in the race and was able to speed up at the end when we told him Norris and Hamilton were behind him.</p>\n<p>\"It is a fantastic job. It was amazing on the management. The race is one thing, but management. From the beginning of the event, he was very solid.\"</p>\n<p>Vasseur said after the race that he is \"optimistic\" over Sainz, who remarkably came to the track to watch from the Ferrari garage on Saturday, will be ready to race in Australia in two weeks\' time.</p>\n<p>Bearman\'s promotion to F1 this weekend meant he lost ground in the F2 championship, which Vasseur insists must be his main focus for the rest of 2024.</p>\n<p>\"At least with Ollie we know we have a good reserve,\" the Frenchman added. \"For Carlos, he needs to have a good recovery and a good rest.</p>\n<p>\"The most important thing is the result of today will be behind us in a couple of weeks and he needs to be focused on the F2 and the challenge ahead of him.</p>\n<p>\"This weekend will have cost him a lot because he was supposed to start on pole in F2.</p>\n<p>\"It means to come back into the championship will be a challenge but he will have the chance to do some P1\'s this year.\"</p>\n<h3>Sky Sports pundits impressed by \'punchy\' drive</h3>\n<p>Former W Series driver, and <em>Sky Sports F1</em> pundit, Naomi Schiff was another onlooker impressed by Bearman\'s style.</p>\n<p>\"Incredible job from him,\" Schiff said. \"He didn\'t set a foot wrong and was really punchy from the beginning.</p>\n<p>\"He showed race pace, aggression and wanting to get the most out of this day. A fantastic job.\"</p>\n<p>Bernie Collins, former head of race strategy at Aston Martin, and <em>Sky Sports F1</em> pundit, appreciated the way the 18-year-old managed his race.</p>         \n<p>\"Fantastic drive from him,\" Collins said. \"To get through that pit stop under the Safety Car with a lot of pressure and a lot of cars in the pit lane</p>\n<p>\"He found it hard to get past Hulkenberg and that\'s where a lot of his race time went.</p>\n<p>\"After that, lap on lap on his own, taking in information about the cars behind him, steady head and it\'s hard to keep that focus for those 50 laps.</p>\n<p>\"I said a top 10 finish would be phenomenal and he\'s overachieved on this result!\"</p>\n<p><strong>Formula 1\'s biggest ever season continues with the Australian Grand Prix from March 22-24, live on Sky Sports F1. </strong><strong>Stream every F1 race and more with a NOW Sports Month Membership - just £21 a month for 12 months.

(313, NULL, '<p>Lewis Hamilton believes Mercedes have still got to make \"big changes\" to their F1 car beyond the widespread overhaul already made for 2024 after a difficult start to the new season continued at the Saudi Arabian GP.</p>\n<p>With Toto Wolff admitting at the end of last season that Mercedes faced a \"mountain to climb\" in their pursuit of Red Bull in the short-term, all of the world champions\' rivals have faced a harsh reminder of the scale of that task in the opening two weekends of the new season following consecutive dominant Max Verstappen-Sergio Perez one-two finishes.</p>\n\n<p>Mercedes, who have made significant changes to their car for 2024 in an attempt to bridge that gap, followed up fifth and seventh places at the Bahrain season-opener with sixth and ninth on Saturday in Saudi Arabia.</p>\n\n<p>Sixth-placed George Russell finished 40 seconds behind victor Verstappen in a 50-lap race that featured a brief early appearance from the Safety Car.</p>\n<p>Hamilton, who ran behind Russell in the opening stages before trying an alternative longer-running strategy and eventually finished ninth, admitted the performance of the new W15 around the high-speed Jeddah street track had felt familiar after similar difficulties in 2023 and 2022.</p>    \n<p>\"The car is relatively good in the low speed and not so bad in the medium [speed], but in the high-speed we are miles off,\" said Hamilton to <em>Sky Sports F1</em>.</p>\n\n<p>\"It was like I was in a different category when I was going through the high-speed between the other guys around me.</p>\n\n        \n<p>\"It\'s frustrating for sure to be in three years in a row in almost the same position. It\'s definitely tough but we will get our heads down and keep working away, and I know everyone back at the factory is pushing as hard as they can.\"</p>\n<p>Mercedes have changed direction with their approach to the current ground-effect cars for this year, describing the W15 at its February unveiling as a \"complete relaunch\", but Hamilton suggested they may not have gone far enough.</p>\n<p>\"We\'ve definitely got to make some big changes,\" added the seven-time champion.</p>\n<p>\"We haven\'t made big enough changes, perhaps. If you look at the three teams ahead of us, they still have different concept to where we are in some areas.</p>\n<p>\"So we\'ve got some performance to add, that\'s for sure.\"</p>         \n<p>Running behind Russell in his grid position of eighth at the time of Lance Stroll\'s crash and the lap-seven Safety Car, Hamilton was one of a handful of drivers not to pit during the three laps in which the race was neutralised.</p>\n<p>This left him up in running third for the lap-11 restart and, although he was soon passed by Perez and Charles Leclerc, Hamilton impressively stayed ahead of Oscar Piastri for 20 laps despite the McLaren having the advantage of fresher tyres.</p>\n<p>He eventually pitted on lap 36 to set up a final short stint on soft tyres but, with Lando Norris just ahead of him on the same strategy and impressive Ferrari debutant Oliver Bearman ultimately out of reach for both of them, Hamilton could not make up any late ground.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, he had no regrets, saying: \"I think it was worth trying something different.</p>         \n<p>\"Splitting the cars and trying different strategies, and ultimately that\'s always the goal to do something a little bit different, particularly when we\'re in the position we\'re in.</p>\n<p>\"I was fighting as hard as I could to go long and I was hoping for a Safety Car or something but it was just unfortunate nothing came out.\"</p>\n<p>Finishes of seventh and ninth represent Hamilton\'s worst start to a season in points terms since 2009 and he added to the written media: \"I wouldn\'t say I\'m having fun. I\'m racing for ninth, or finishing ninth is definitely not fun. I am enjoying the actual racing part.</p>\n<p>\"I was hunting and I was pushing as hard as I could, I was maximising everything I had with the car, I was right on the edge, it was just unfortunately really lacking performance in the high speed where they were walking all over us. \"</p>\n<h3>Wolff \'100 per cent sure\' Mercedes will find more speed</h3>\n<p>Speaking to reporters after the race, Mercedes boss Wolff said the team believed there was inherent high-speed cornering performance to find in the W15 but that they were still working out how to unlock it through set-up.</p>\n<p>\"I think there\'s a bigger factor with lacking high-speed than just the rear wing [settings],\" said the Mercedes team principal.</p>\n<p>\"We are missing downforce beyond the steps that you would have with a bigger rear wing. We tried it on Lewis [in Thursday practice].</p>\n<p>\"There is something which we don\'t understand. We are quick everywhere else pretty much. We know that we have a smaller rear wing, we are compensating what we are losing through the corners, but it\'s just the high-speed variant where we are losing all the lap time.</p>\n<p>\"There is only so much you can tune here. Our simulations point us in a direction, and this is the kind of set-up range that we then choose. You put the right rear wing on and I think you gain a few tenths or not if you get the set-up right or wrong but there\'s not a massive corridor of performance.</p>\n<p>\"It\'s more a fundamental thing that we believe that the speed should be there, and we measure the downforce but we don\'t find it on the lap time.\"</p>\n<p>With a two-week gap to the next race in Australia, Wolff added: \"That\'s been two years that there is something which we need to spot and that\'s the thing to unlock.</p>\n<p>\"It\'s not by lack of trying - we push so hard and we\'re going to give it a massive, massive go now in the next week with more data to understand and come back to Melbourne stronger.</p>\n<p>\"We\'re on a mission with this one and I\'m 100 per cent sure we\'re going to unlock that performance gap.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Formula 1\'s biggest ever season continues with the Australian Grand Prix from March 22-24, live on Sky Sports F1. </strong><strong>Stream every F1 race and more with a NOW Sports Month Membership - just &#163;21 a month for 12 months.

It was their intensity, and it took me back to when Jurgen Klopp first came in at Liverpool where people were running everywhere,\" said <em>Sky Sports</em> pundit Carragher.</p>    \n<p>\"They didn\'t have as many games and they\'ve had injuries this season so what happens is you\'re using the same players who are fit, then that sort of intensity drops also.</p>\n\n<p>\"It looks like a team who are almost ready for the end of the season. If I just looked at that performance and I didn\'t know this team, that is not acceptable the way they defended. This is an average Chelsea team, let\'s not forget that.\"</p>\n\n \n<p>Newcastle have been without first-choice goalkeeper Nick Pope since December, but Carragher says their demise points to a wider issue defensively.</p>\n<p>He added: \"Pope is a big part of this team. He\'s one of the best shot stoppers in the Premier League and he sweeps up behind that high line and press that we\'ve seen. It is a big part, but it\'s not just about that. There\'s more to it.</p>\n<p>\"If you look at shots faced in the game, you go from the fourth-best in the league to 15th. That\'s not just the goalkeeper, that\'s to do with the set-up in the team. The save ratio you would expect to be down.</p> \n<p>\"The one that stands out is conceding three-plus goals, being the worst in the league - eight times in the last 14 games. That is unbelievable. This is for a team who, last season, were fantastic defensively.</p>\n<p>\"In the past, when you look at Eddie Howe\'s teams - and a different level of team with Bournemouth - if they keep going as they are, they\'re on course to conceded 60-plus goals and that will have happened six times in seven years as a manager.\"</p>\n<h3>Wright: Newcastle were very poor</h3> \n<p><em>Monday Night Football</em> guest Ian Wright questioned Newcastle\'s approach against Chelsea and said he was disappointed by their performance.</p>\n<p>He said: \"I was very surprised that they played a high line and the press wasn\'t very good at all, especially when you consider Nick Pope is a very good sweeper keeper. Sven Botman coming in had a poor game today.</p>\n<p>\"I cannot understand why they didn\'t play a deep block and frustrate Chelsea more. I was confused by some of the things Eddie was saying [in his post-match interview] because I didn\'t see where they had any kind of control.</p>\n<p>\"I thought Bruno Guimaraes was very poor, couldn\'t get himself away from the fact that Nicolas Jackson and Conor Gallagher were in and around him. There wasn\'t enough movement from him.</p>\n<p>\"In the main, Tino Livramento tried, but overall, very poor from them.\"</p>\n<h3>Howe: We can defend better than tonight</h3>         \n<p>Newcastle boss Howe agreed that his side could have been better defensively and says they are in a tough spell after just two wins in their last seven games in all competitions.</p>\n<p>\"Strange game, frustrating one for us because we started well and conceded with their first attack,\" he told <em>Sky Sports</em>. I don\'t think it was a game with a lot of chances, but it was a high-scoring game.</p>\n<p>\"We were good in spells but obviously not good enough overall because the goals we conceded were really poor.</p>\n<p>\"I don\'t think we had a problem with the overall flow of the game. We were competitive and creative, the final ball was maybe not good enough today. We had a lot of opportunities to test their back four.</p>\n<p>\"All three goals [conceded] were similar in their characteristics. We didn\'t defend those situations well enough and you\'re going to lose games if you do that.</p>\n<p>\"It is a familiar feeling from the last few months for us on the road. It\'s been a tough spell for us and tonight epitomised that for us.

Premier League clubs don\'t want to give more money away to EFL clubs when they don\'t know what their own financial situations are going to be.</p>\n<p>\"The clubs have said: \'Hold on, what we want to do is replace PSR with a new financial regulation system. We\'re going to do that first and once we have that new financial system in place, then we will look again at how much money we pass on to EFL clubs\'.</p>\n<p>\"It\'s self-interest for the Premier League clubs. All clubs will always look after themselves. They feel the PSR as they exist at the moment are not fit for purpose. Now you could counter that and argue they\'re rules that they agreed to. They voted for them. So they signed up to them, they came into force and the feeling now is they don\'t work.</p>\n<p>\"How the new proposal would work, which is closely aligned to UEFA\'s financial rules, is that Premier League clubs would only spend up to a maximum of 85 per cent of your revenue on transfers and wages. That sounds like it could be fairer, because at the moment we\'ve got a system where you can\'t lose more than &#163;105m over a three-year period.</p>\n<p>\"Now this might sound like a better system, but does it mean that going forward, the bigger clubs are always going to have more money to spend on transfers and wages?</p>\n<p>\"Because if you\'re only allowed to spend a limit of 85 per cent of your revenue on players and wages, if your revenue is &#163;700m, you\'ll be able to spend &#163;595m on players and wages. But if your revenue is only &#163;100m, you\'ll only be able to spend &#163;85m on players and wages. So I\'m sure that will be something Premier League clubs will look at.\"</p>         \n<h3>PSR explained: What limits clubs spending more?</h3>\n<p>In the simplest terms, when every Premier League team tots up their annual accounts, they can have made a loss no greater than &#163;105m across the previous three seasons.</p>\n<p>Clubs can only lose &#163;15m of their <em>own money </em>across those three years. So that\'s no more than &#163;15m extra on outgoings like transfer fees, player wages and, in a lot of clubs\' cases, paying off former managers compared to their income from TV payments, season tickets, selling players and so on.</p>\n<p>The other &#163;90m of any &#163;105m must be guaranteed by their owners buying up shares, known as \'secure funding\', and essentially means bankrolling the club.</p>', '2024-03-12 11:28:55', '2024-03-12 11:28:55', 'Premier League\'s profitability and sustainability rules set to be replaced', 'https://e1.365dm.com/24/02/384x216/skysports-premier-league-logo_6446582.jpg?20240206165523', 'sports', 'https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13092774/premier-leagues-profit-and-sustainability-rules-to-be-replaced-as-early-as-this-summer', 'The Premier League\'s controversial profitability and sustainability rules are set to be replaced as early as this summer by a new system of financial regulation.', 'football'),

When I wrote the piece, I thought perhaps this sounded a bit too sad for a recital. So I set it aside for the time being. </p>\n\n<p>\"Sometime after, when I was making the score of Final Fantasy X, I was falling behind all the while the producers were hounding me. So since that flute piece was unused, I just kind of meekly handed it to them. They listened to it and said, \'Yes! This is brilliant!\'\" </p>\n\n<p>In retrospect, it\'s wild \"To Zanarkand\" wasn\'t originally composed by Uematsu for Final Fantasy X because it fits the game\'s themes so well, nailing the somber and sad tone present throughout Tidus and Yuna\'s journey in Spira. </p>\n\n<p>For more about Final Fantasy music, read <i>Game Informer\'s </i>exclusive four-part series on composer Masayoshi Soken\'s score for last year\'s Final Fantasy XVI:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Part 1: Creating The Prelude</li>\n	<li>Part 2: The Victory Fanfare</li>\n	<li>Part 3: Finding A Main Theme</li>\n	<li>Part 4: The Sound</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After that, read <i>Game Informer\'s </i>review of Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster. </p>\n\n<hr>\n<p><em>What\'s your favorite Final Fantasy theme song?

Set to go live today on PlayStation 5 and PC, Patch 1.000.102 follows a patch from last week that introduced fire tornadoes, meteor showers, weapon buffs, and more to the shooter. </p>\n\n<p>\"Good day citizens of Super Earth,\" the patch notes read. \"A new patch to aid you in your efforts is coming in. May Super Earth give you courage. Today\'s patch is dealing with the spawn rate of heavily armored Terminid enemies as well as the possible play against them.

Arrowhead says to expect other enemy types to appear in greater numbers instead. However, the patch notes say Arrowhead is lowering the health of the Charger\'s head, making it easier to target that weak point with something like a Recoilless Rifle or EAT-17, which will instantly kill a charger. </p>\n\n<p>Elsewhere in the patch, the Electronic Countermeasures stratagem has been confirmed as removed – it was actually removed in a past last week but patch notes didn\'t mention it – so it can be reworked. Here are some other fixes in today\'s balance update: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed missing text on several HUD / UI elements.</li>\n	<li>Fixed several subtitle / VO mismatches in the news videos.</li>\n	<li>Fixed various crashes that occurred mid-gameplay and when deploying to missions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information on things like known issues within the game, head to the full patch notes here.

Writer Bryan Vore gave the game’s beta incarnation an 8 out of 10 in our review, writing that “Living games have the potential to go in frustrating directions, but MultiVersus has a strong foundation.

If we\'re lucky, version 4.5 may arrive up to an hour early.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>New five-star Geo character Chiori is the star of version 4.5. Billed as an off-field damage dealer, Chiori scales off both attack and defense, and primarily uses summonable dolls to automatically attack nearby enemies. She\'ll get an extra doll if you use her elemental skill in conjunction with a Geo construct like Zhongli\'s pillar or Itto\'s friend Ushi, meaning Chiori is designed to be played with multiple Geo characters in one team. Her ultimate is a simple burst of damage, making her quite similar to Albedo overall, but seemingly a fair bit stronger.&#160;</p>\n<p>Chiori will debut alongside returning five-star Itto, with their shared banner four-star characters being Yun Jin, Gorou, and Dori.

The new operation kicked off just earlier today, March 12, and it already looks to be a grand operation for Helldivers 2 players to partake in.</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"see-more__button\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"See more\">See more</span>\n\n<p>Four planets are now available for liberation in Helldivers 2: Erata Prime, Fenrir III, Meridia, and Turing; all on the eastern side of the Galactic War board. These four planets have a brand new mission type, which tasks players with activating the Terminid Control System in Helldivers 2 to contain the buggy threat.</p>\n\n\n<p>Instead of the usual \'Liberation\' bar, all four of these planets have a \'TCS Installation Progress\' bar, which governs how much the new initiative has been progressed over the four worlds. In fact, these four aren\'t the subject of the usual \'Liberation Campaign\' - they\'re actually classed as a \"High-Priority Campaign.\"&#160;</p>\n\n<p>This isn\'t the first time the TCS has been mentioned in Helldivers 2. While the operation to free the mechs on Tien Kwan was underway last week, the TCS was rumbling in the background, although the four planets weren\'t yet available to fight on. Since Tien Kwan is now free from the Automaton threat, the presumption is that the engineers in that world are headed over to install the TCS on Erata Prime, Fenrir III, Meridia, and Turing.</p>\n\n<p>Here\'s hoping that, once the TCS installation meter is completely finished on all four platforms, the \"Termicide\" will rain down and vanquish the Terminids for good across the frontier.

(337, NULL, '<p>A prototype of Free Radical\'s canceled FPS sequel TimeSplitters 4 has been found and preserved online, all thanks to one observant collector who spotted a tiny detail in what seemed like an unremarkable eBay listing for a PS3 test console.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier this month, Reddit user Flimsy-Zebra3775 posed a question to r/PS3 members: \"Is this a prototype game?\" (Thanks, Time Extension). Included in that post was an image from an eBay listing for a PS3 test console - one that showed a logo for TimeSplitters 4. \"It\'s from a reputable normal eBay seller,\" Flimsy-Zebra3775 explained. \"They were as surprised as me when I asked them about it.\"</p>\n<p>After some back and forth with the seller, Flimsy-Zebra3775 learned that \"they indeed had a friend who worked at Free Radical until November 2008, a month before the studio shut down.\" A video seemed to prove that the prototype was legit, and Flimsy-Zebra3775 quickly bought it and got in contact with preservationists to ensure the game could be archived. \"&#163;525 down but for history and my collection it\'s worth it,\" they joked.</p>\n\n\n<p>The history of TimeSplitters is a long and complicated thing, but you can get a detailed breakdown from our friends at Retro Gamer magazine at that link. In short, developer Free Radical was formed by veterans of Rare, and hot off the success of early console shooters like GoldenEye and Perfect Dark they built the TimeSplitters series as a sort of spiritual successor. Similar mechanics, but TimeSplitters ditched the spy setting for a goofier time travel conceit.</p>\n\n<p>The three TimeSplitters games quickly became cult classics, but by 2008 - with the lackluster response to Haze and the cancellation of the studio\'s work on Star Wars: Battlefront 3 - it was in dire straits. A prototype for TimeSplitters 4 was shopped around to various publishers, but it seems nobody was interested. Free Radical went into administration - that\'s basically bankruptcy, for my fellow Americans - and its remnants were acquired by Crysis developer Crytek shortly afterward.</p>\n\n<iframe data-lazy-priority=\"high\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ehsLVShAl40\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>This newly preserved prototype, which you can check out over on Hidden Palace, appears to be the same one Free Radical was shopping to publishers at the time it went under. It\'s a pretty simple demo, featuring a single multiplayer map that you can populate with a variety of bots, but it does showcase the series\' trademark visual charm, and the visuals look pretty impressive for a pre-release bit of PS3 software. If you want to play it yourself, you\'ll need a modded PS3 to do so, since it currently crashes on the emulator RPCS3.</p>\n<p>But the demo is probably of more historical than gameplay value for the average TimeSplitters fan, anyway. The preservation of this prototype has caused quite a stir among the game\'s community, even prompting a response from Free Radical co-founder David Doak. \"This is exactly the kind of nonsense that &lt;insert any publisher name&gt; wasn&#8217;t interested in back in 2008,\" Doak writes on Twitter. \"You&#8217;re welcome.\"</p>\n<p>This is the most substantial look we\'ve had yet at what might have been TimeSplitters 4, though fan projects like the Free Radical Archive have been collecting traces of concept art and teaser videos over the years. Still, it\'s mostly been bad news for TimeSplitters fans in recent times. The Free Radical name eventually ended up under the Embracer Group banner, and the studio was reformed a few years ago with several of its original creative leads aiming to helm a new TimeSplitters game. The new Free Radical was shut down in December 2023, amid Embracer Group\'s massive wave of cancellations, shut downs, and layoffs.&#160;</p>\n<p><em>Back in 2022, a </em><em>Battlefront 3 test build turned out to be an entirely different Star Wars game</em><em>.</em></p>', '2024-03-13 03:00:01', '2024-03-13 03:00:01', 'After 16 years, the canceled FPS TimeSplitters 4 gets saved and preserved through a seemingly unremarkable eBay listing for a PS3 test console', 'https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3Y8Q7B7XYF5ayJywvRA39E.jpg', 'games', 'https://www.gamesradar.com/after-16-years-the-canceled-fps-timesplitters-4-gets-saved-and-preserved-through-a-seemingly-unremarkable-ebay-listing-for-a-ps3-test-console/', 'A prototype of Free Radical\'s canceled FPS sequel TimeSplitters 4 has been found...', ''),

Whether you\'re looking at a Ruby or Precious Claw though, there\'s only one thing you can currently do with them &#8211; sell the lot for some juicy profit.&#160;In the Reddit post below, one player admitted to amassing more than 200,000 gold worth of valuable items, all because they didn\'t realize they weren\'t used in any crafting recipes.</p>\n<p>However, despite having what you\'d think would be a clear-cut purpose, some players are suspicious, and think that just because we can\'t craft anything with the items <em>now </em>doesn\'t mean that we won\'t be able to later. Palworld is still in early access, after all, so a lot of things can be expected to change and evolve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"I refuse to sell anything that\'s not \'used\' as of yet. The game just got released, who knows what will be used late game that you just sold. Nope not falling for that again,\" one Reddit user <u>wrote</u>.</p>\n\n<p>\"I\'ve been burned a few times selling those items in different games and it turned out they were useful late game,\" <u>commented</u> another. &#160;</p>\n\n<p>You really can\'t blame people for thinking like this when games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild use gemstones to upgrade armor, despite tempting us all to sell them for a generous amount of Rupees. Even so, there\'s nothing to prove at this point that this will end up happening in Palworld, too, so if you\'re really running low on in-game cash, don\'t be too afraid to sell.&#160;</p>\n<p><em>Check out our guide to the </em><u><em>best Palworld base locations and upgrades</em></u><em> for some tips to help you on your adventure. </em>&#160;</p>', '2024-03-13 03:00:01', '2024-03-13 03:00:01', 'This Palworld player was sitting on a Jetragon\'s hoard of valuable items worth 200,000 gold, all because they didn\'t believe they wouldn\'t need them for late-game crafting', 'https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eKQTstuuSTwYnDdbyaFaMC.jpg', 'games', 'https://www.gamesradar.com/this-palworld-player-was-sitting-on-a-jetragons-hoard-of-valuable-items-worth-200000-gold-all-because-they-didnt-believe-they-wouldnt-need-them-for-late-game-crafting/', 'Many Palworld players are straight up refusing to make the most of one of the su...', ''),
(339, NULL, '<p>There is no shortage of big bugs to tackle in Helldivers 2, not least the colossal Terminids known as Bile Titans, but if the latest fan theory is to be believed, a much bigger and more formidable foe is on the way.</p>\n\n<p>Over on the Helldivers 2 subreddit, long-time fan Tnel1027 has posted an image of themselves standing next to a statue of a rather frightening-looking bug, or at least what looks like a statue. According to the player, these (for there are more than one) are not, in fact, statues but \"molts\" from a Hive Lord - a \"massive sandworm-like creature\" from the first game.</p>\n\n<p>Not only is this enormous enemy extremely dangerous to go head to head with, but it\'s also able to create new underground tunnels for bug hives, making victory in the Galactic War a whole lot harder. As well as the so-called statues, Tnel1027 suggests that the tremors you may have witnessed if you\'ve recently delved into the shooter \"could be the hints that this bad boy is coming soon.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>In the comments, some other Helldivers veterans point out that, despite being absolutely huge, Bile Titans are actually considered \"medium-sized\" enemies, leaving many who\'ve jumped it at Helldivers 2 feeling more than a little nervous. \"Excuse Me?!\"&#160;says IceColdCocaCola in the comments. \"What the FUCK. How large can the enemies get in this game?\" Almighty_Brian writes, \"You put that thing back where it came from or so help me.\"</p>\n\n<p>Others are excited at the prospect of this epic beast making an appearance, including RampagedAlpaca, who was convinced they were \"gonna get eaten by a big ass worm creature\" when the tremors appeared. \"Now I\'m sad that I didn\'t,\" they write, \"I\'m really excited that this might be a possibility.\" Then there\'s MrJoemazing, who says, \"It\'s stuff like this that makes me so excited for the future of this game. It\'s like a massive sci-fi D&amp;D campaign we are all playing together.\"</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, playing together is what Helldivers 2 is all about. The community recently got together to liberate Tien Kwan after developer Arrowhead declared the factory planet to be under attack. Their bravery and determination were swiftly rewarded with the arrival of mechs, which, incidentally, could help level the playing field should bigger threats be introduced.</p>\n<p><em>Here\'s how </em><em>Helldivers 2 lights the way for AAA by rejecting its norms</em><em>.</em></p>', '2024-03-13 03:00:01', '2024-03-13 03:00:01', 'Helldivers 2 players are preparing for the worst as clues suggest a classic enemy much bigger than Bile Titans could be about to rear its ugly head', 'https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DGWPd9ni5xMEQHDxrzeTFS.jpg', 'games', 'https://www.gamesradar.com/helldivers-2-players-are-preparing-for-the-worst-as-clues-suggest-a-classic-enemy-much-bigger-than-bile-titans-could-be-about-to-rear-its-ugly-head/', 'There is no shortage of big bugs to tackle in Helldivers 2, not least the coloss...', ''),
(340, NULL, '<p>Helldivers 2 players are once again honing in on Malevelon Creek, and others are worried it\'s going to drag the Galactic War effort into the mud.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, the fight for Malevelon Creek is back on. After originally losing Malevelon Creek to the Automatons earlier this month, players banded together to repel the robotic forces in droves, but even so, the percentage of the planet they\'ve managed to actually conquer is negligible at the time of writing.&#160;</p>\n<p>Now, some players are calling for the Galactic War effort to hone in on Malevelon Creek and conquer the planet once and for all. The Helldivers 2 subreddit post from earlier this week, seen just below, is a call to arms for all Helldivers to descend on the planet and liberate it later this week on March 16.</p>\n\n\n\n\nHelldivers 2 guides\n<p class=\"fancy-box__body-text\"><strong>Helldivers 2 best weapons</strong> <br><strong>Helldivers 2 meta</strong><strong><br></strong><strong>Helldivers 2 best stratagems</strong>&#160;</p>\n\n<p>The post has a lot of support, with over 6,400 upvotes from players seemingly pledging their support for the cause. However, plenty of others are sceptical of the new approach for going all-in on Malevelon Creek, effectively calling it a huge and unworthy gamble.</p>\n\n<p>\"For real... the Automatons are gonna waltz right on up to Cyberstan unimpeded because of y\'all misguided creekers...\" one Reddit user writes in response. Another player reckons that the war effort should instead be focused on other planets, namely Ustotu and Draupnir, before Helldivers then naturally progress to Malevelon Creek instead.</p>\n\n<p>For what it\'s worth, since the original post above went live yesterday, Draupnir has seek its conquer meter tick up significantly. At the time of writing, Draupnir is 12% liberated thanks to a force of 43,000 Helldivers, and based on other recent posts, that\'s an increase of nearly 10% since the same time yesterday.&#160;</p>\n<p>Looking at the wider picture though, things still aren\'t great for Draupnir. According to another subreddit post from five days ago, the planet was sitting at a comfortable 55% liberated, so for this to fall into the single digits inside a week is a painful blow for Super Earth\'s forces.&#160;</p>\n<p>According to this Helldivers 2 tracker and our own boots on the ground, there are just 5,000 Helldivers on Ustotu right now, while 7,700 Super Earth soldiers are on Malevelon Creek. Both those numbers are a far cry from Draupnir\'s forces, so perhaps the pleas of those concerned with focusing too much on Malevelon Creek are actually getting through to others. (Or perhaps a lot of Helldivers 2 players are fair weather fans eagerly hopping to whatever planet is the new hotness, but I digress.)&#160;</p>\n\n<p>In actual fact, the original Reddit user who posted the call to action above is down with taking Draupnir first. \"5 days to build stronger. 5 days to prepare for March 16th. Those willing should use this time of preparation to aide the Helldivers of Draupnir. Use the planet as an example for what we are capable of,\" they wrote in response to the calls to liberate Draupnir first.</p>\n<p>The scepticism from players is actually very well-founded. Helldivers 2 players lose ground on planets because the Automaton and Terminid forces don\'t sleep, so while you\'re slumbering away, the enemy armies are steadily gaining ground where there are no players to repel them. With all the focus on Malevelon Creek, you can see why some are worried other planets will fall.</p>\n<p><em>Read up on our </em><em>Helldivers 2 meta</em><em> guide for a look over the current optimal build and loadouts for conquering planets.&#160;</em></p>', '2024-03-13 03:00:01', '2024-03-13 03:00:01', 'With Automatons threatening Ustotu and Draupnir, Helldivers 2 grunts worry the obsession with recapturing the infamous Malevelon Creek might derail the war effort', 'https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EUZjRuM6v65MgXZ7VWPFnP.jpg', 'games', 'https://www.gamesradar.com/with-automatons-threatening-ustotu-and-draupnir-helldivers-2-grunts-worry-the-obsession-with-recapturing-the-infamous-malevelon-creek-might-derail-the-war-effort/', 'Helldivers 2 players are once again honing in on Malevelon Creek, and others are...', ''),

Arrowhead writes that while it hasn\'t reduced the health of their legs, it has knocked down the hit points of their heads to the point where a single well-placed shot from a Recoilless Rifle or an EAT-17 instantly kills them.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"see-more__button\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"See more\">See more</span>\n\n<p>\"Together with the unfortunately undocumented change of last patch that increased the armor penetration ability of less well-placed shots for EAT-17s and Recoilless Rifle shots, Chargers should now be easier to handle by well-equipped groups,\" another entry on the patch notes reads.</p>\n\n<p>This could have huge implications for Helldivers 2 players, in particular those who regularly squad up against Terminid forces. Chargers are undoubtedly some of the game\'s more annoying enemies, and handing players a proven method of taking them out in just one shot is big news.</p>\n\n<p>Elsewhere, the spawn rates of enemies, particularly Terminids, are being altered. Players should now encounter fewer Charger and Bile Titans on difficulties seven and up, and the new patch should prevent \"spawn spikes\" with the two enemy classes, where hordes of the creatures are seen at once.&#160;Now we wait for Hulk changes, divers.&#160;</p>\n<p>Another notable change is the removal of the unpopular Electronic Countermeasures operation modifier, which could randomly screw with your Stratagems. This was actually cut in a previous update, but Arrowhead says it was \"unintentionally omitted from the patch notes.\" It sounds like the devs agreed with the players here: \"We found that this modifier wasn&#8217;t communicated clearly enough and overall caused more frustration than excitement with the way it was currently implemented.\"</p>\n<p>As per usual with new Helldivers 2 patches, the new update includes a litany of bug and crash fixes.

According to director Hideaki Itsuno, the devs haven\'t been considering \"any form of multiplayer\" at all.</p>\n\n<p>This shouldn\'t really be too surprising, even if it might be a bit disappointing for some. After all, the first Dragon\'s Dogma game (and its enhanced version, Dark Arisen) didn\'t have multiplayer, and Dragon\'s Dogma 2 has previously been described by Capcom as a single-player experience, too. Based on Itsuno\'s comments in an <u>interview with Automaton</u>, it doesn\'t sound like that\'s going to change post-launch, either.</p>\n<p>\"We have not been considering any form of multiplayer for Dragon\'s Dogma 2,\" Itsuno says. \"I think online games have their good sides; just as offline games have their own. But the concept of the original game was to incorporate fun gameplay elements not found in conventional offline games while removing all the \'hassles\' of online games. This is one of the basic original ideas of the first game that I don\'t plan on straying from.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>Although there won\'t be any multiplayer options in the game, however, we\'ll still be able to share our Pawns as we could before, allowing friends and players from around the world to travel with our creations. In the Automaton interview, producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi notes that this means that streamers will be able to use their viewers\' Pawns in their game. Itsuno adds: \"It would be fun to see my Pawns being used by a famous streamer. The Pawn system itself has been around for some time, but I think it can be used in more modern ways now too.\"</p>\n\n<p>Although Dragon\'s Dogma 2 isn\'t out yet, it seems very likely that sharing Pawns will be a popular feature. Capcom has already released <u>Dragon\'s Dogma 2\'s character creator</u> for free, allowing us to create a handful of Arisen and Pawns in advance to transfer to the full game. Using these tools, players have <u>managed to create some seriously impressive characters</u>, including incredible recreations of <u>Baldur\'s Gate 3\'s</u> Shadowheart and The Witcher\'s Geralt.</p>\n\n<p><em>Looking for a new adventure to pass the time before Dragon\'s Dogma 2\'s release on March 22?

What Hamaguchi certainly wasn\'t expecting, though, was a lot of the conversations to be about yellow paint.</p>\n<p>In an interview with Redbull, when asked for his response to the fierce debate over the telegraphing technique that erupted following the release of the Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth demo last month, Hamaguchi replied, \"I didn\'t think that the \'yellow paint\' would be something that would be discussed on social media.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>There\'s no denying that it serves a valuable function, but for some, having smatterings of bright paint all over the place is immersion-breaking, and with it being such a divisive feature, Hamaguchi hints that he and the team may consider other methods for guiding players in the future.</p>\n\n<p>\"For things like camera options, where people have a wide variety of preferences and there\'s no one right answer, our basic approach is to offer various accessibility options,\" the director explains, \"so I would like to take on board the valuable feedback we have received towards this for future games.\"</p>\n\n<p>Those future games, of course, include the conclusion of Cloud\'s story which is currently in the works. In a separate interview, Hamaguchi recently confirmed that \"key elements\" of the third and final part of the Remake trilogy are already coming together thanks to all the world-building in Rebirth.</p>\n<p>It remains to be seen how much yellow paint there will be in part 3, but its inclusion in Rebirth hasn\'t stopped it from becoming&#160;the series\' highest-rated entry in 23 years&#160;and the second-highest-scoring Final Fantasy on Metacritic overall.</p>\n<p><em>Ignore the yellow paint detractors &#8211; visual cues are great for games.</em></p>', '2024-03-13 03:00:01', '2024-03-13 03:00:01', 'Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth\'s director wasn\'t expecting the RPG to reignite the \'yellow paint\' discourse, but will \"take on board the valuable feedback for future games\"', 'https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TTa55wHwiotK49idPueWGV.jpg', 'games', 'https://www.gamesradar.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirths-director-wasnt-expecting-the-rpg-to-reignite-the-yellow-paint-discourse-but-will-take-on-board-the-valuable-feedback-for-future-games/', 'Responding to the yellow paint discourse, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth\'s director say...', ''),
(347, NULL, '<p><u>Cyberpunk 2077</u>\'s director has said that CD Projekt Red is \"done\" working on the RPG but says it may still add the odd small feature when needed.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>In an interview with <u>Game File</u>, the director of Cyberpunk 2077 (for the 2.0 update and Phantom Liberty DLC), Gabe Amatangelo, discusses the development of the futuristic RPG as well as its upcoming sequel which is currently codenamed Orion. \"We\'re done,\" Amatangelo told the outlet, before revealing that: \"It\'s possible that there\'s some other little thing that comes in here or there.\"&#160;</p>\n<p>Before you get too excited for more Cyberpunk 2077 content, the director followed it up with: \"Just because, as you\'re kind of messing around with stuff, sometimes you discover something that is not a high risk. Or it\'s easy to integrate. Or, you know, some developers have some bandwidth.\" Talking about other members of the CD Projekt Red team, Amatangelo said: \"Then they bring it to me. I\'m like, \'All right, well, I trust you that it isn\'t going to mess with your other work&#8230; So let\'s give it a go.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>Other than the <u>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty</u> DLC, which launched in September 2023, the other recent big overhaul came in the form of the <u>Cyberpunk 2077 patch 2.1</u> which added an immersive metro system as a \"role-playing feature.\" In an <u>interview</u> with GamesRadar+, the game\'s quest designer Danisz Markiewicz revealed that the metro network was \"always part of Night City lore and urban planning\" even ahead of Cyberpunk 2077 and Phantom Liberty\'s release.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>With this in mind, it\'s probably best to assume that the odd \"little thing\" Amatangelo mentions above is less complex than the metro network and the other stuff rolled out in the 2.1 update.

(348, NULL, '<p>Last week, the popular Nintendo Switch emulator <u>Yuzu was taken down after Nintendo filed a lawsuit</u> against developer Tropic Haze, which ended up agreeing to a $2.4 million settlement. Despite this, the developers behind an upcoming replacement emulator, \'Suyu,\' seem confident that they can avoid a similar outcome.</p>\n\n<p>After Yuzu\'s shutdown, it was only a matter of <u>hours before replacements began flooding the internet</u> in an attempt to take the emulator\'s place. These came despite Nintendo making its stance against emulation very clear, with its official Intellectual Property and Piracy frequently asked questions <u>page</u> stating that it\'s forbidden to download older games that aren\'t sold anymore, ROMs of games you already own, and make backup copies of your games. Specifically regarding emulation, it notes: \"While we recognize the passion that players have for classic games, supporting emulation also supports the illegal piracy of our products.\"</p>\n<p>Even so, the team behind Suyu is doing its best to avoid ending up in the same trouble that Yuzu did, after allegedly consulting someone who\'s been to law school for legal advice. Speaking to <u>Ars Technica</u>, one of the emulator\'s contributors reveals that Suyu won\'t be monetized, won\'t provide guides to help users play games, and, furthermore, it\'s taking a strict anti-piracy stance. Tying into this, users will supposedly be required to use real game keys from titles they own and have paid for, as well as the firmware from their Switch. However, it was noted by the contributor that there\'s no way for the emulator to verify for certain that these are obtained legitimately.</p>\n\n\n<p>It\'s worth noting that following the lawsuit, the team behind Yuzu also expressed a strong anti-piracy stance, and said that it had \"always been against piracy\" and was \"not intending to cause harm.\" It added: \"Piracy was never our intention, and we believe that piracy of video games and on video games consoles should end.\"&#160;</p>\n\n<p>With that in mind, it\'s not clear if Suyu\'s anti-piracy stance will help it avoid legal trouble. Again, Nintendo has previously made it clear that making backups of games you already own is not permitted, so it still doesn\'t sound like the company will be a huge fan of this emulator, either. We\'ll just have to watch this space to see if it\'ll end up following in its predecessor Yuzu\'s footsteps.&#160;</p>\n\n<p><em>If you\'re looking for more games to play on your Nintendo Switch, you can check out our recommendations for the </em><u><em>best Nintendo Switch games</em></u><em>.&#160;</em></p>', '2024-03-13 03:00:01', '2024-03-13 03:00:01', 'Struck-down Switch emulator Yuzu has been resurrected as \'Suyu\', and its devs are convinced this one can avoid a Nintendo lawsuit', 'https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eTW7fCiYfv2W5c7VBPKUjc.jpg', 'games', 'https://www.gamesradar.com/struck-down-switch-emulator-yuzu-has-been-resurrected-as-suyu-and-its-devs-are-convinced-this-one-can-avoid-a-nintendo-lawsuit/', 'Last week, the popular Nintendo Switch emulator Yuzu was taken down after Ninten...', ''),
(349, NULL, '<p>Persona 3 Reload players are review-bombing the new Expansion Pass for the JRPG on Steam after it was revealed that the pass will cost $35.</p>\n\n<p>Last week, Atlus revealed the Persona 3 Reload Expansion Pass, with DLC set to debut via the pass this week in the form of brand-new costumes and music tracks. Crucially, Episode Aigis: The Answer is rounding out the DLC offerings later this year in September with a full remake of the original epilogue-style expansion from Persona 3 FES.</p>\n<p>Now that the Expansion Pass is live for players to purchase, it\'s been revealed that it costs $35 in total. Over on Steam, players are reacting negatively to the price tag, with 137 user reviews for the Expansion Pass, giving it an overall rating of \'Mostly Negative.\'&#160;</p>\n\n\n<p>\"People who bought the $100 digital premium edition or $200 Aigis edition should be entitled to this,\" reads the top user review for the Expansion Pass. Another similarly negative review says, \"I wish it came with the base game instead of another 35 bucks, but whatever.\"</p>\n\n<p>Another problem that players are raising is that, right now, you\'re effectively putting down $35 for music tracks. Only \'Wave One\' of the DLC is out right now, which offers music tracks from Persona 5 Royal and Persona 4 Golden to play while you\'re exploring Tartarus in Persona 3 Reload.</p>\n\n<p>In May, you\'ll get costumes to wear while delving into dungeons, as well as more music tracks in \'Wave Two,\' while Episode Aigis: The Answer rounds out the DLC with \'Wave Three\' in September. With only the first wave of DLC available right now in the form of music tracks, players are saying that the DLC tracks simply aren\'t worth the $35 asking price.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, though, veteran Persona 3 fans are getting ready to defend Yukari all over again when Episode Aigis drops later this year. The return of The Answer has a lot of dormant feelings bubbling to the surface, and it\'ll be interesting to see how newcomers fare with the epilogue come September.&#160;</p>\n<p><em>It took 86 hours for me to realize that I love Persona 3 Reload (and probably JRPGs in general)</em><em>.&#160;</em></p>', '2024-03-13 03:00:01', '2024-03-13 03:00:01', 'Persona 3 Reload\'s new Expansion Pass slammed with negative Steam reviews by fans who have already spent over $100 on premium editions', 'https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KgNK5f5JGLzYG2YtKaenv7.jpg', 'games', 'https://www.gamesradar.com/persona-3-reloads-new-expansion-pass-slammed-with-negative-steam-reviews-by-fans-who-have-already-spent-over-dollar100-on-premium-editions/', 'Persona 3 Reload players are review-bombing the new Expansion Pass for the JRPG ...', ''),

(353, NULL, '<p>Fulham centre-back Tosin Adarabioyo is in the midst of some of his best form and arguably one of the main factors behind the team\'s recent improvement.</p>\n<p>His performances in the surprise wins over Manchester United and Brighton were hugely influential, and he is continuing what should be seen as a strong turnaround in his status at Craven Cottage, having appeared to be leaving for Monaco last summer.</p>\n\n<p>Tosin was an England youth international at U16, U17, U18 and U19 levels and once one of Manchester City\'s brightest prospects, talked up by Pep Guardiola. At Fulham, he has been integral to two promotion seasons and their survival in the Premier League so far under Marco Silva.</p>\n\n\n<p>Yet the 26-year-old has never had a senior call-up for England and is not normally in the conversation for Gareth Southgate\'s squads.</p>\n<p>As we approach the European Championships this summer, there is a debate to be had over who should be selected among the England centre-backs, given <strong>John Stones </strong>is arguably the only shoo-in.</p>    \n<p>The jury still is out on <strong>Harry Maguire</strong> due to his stuttering club form, although Southgate likes to stick with players whom he has relied on so much in the past. Even if Maguire goes, there are still as many as two places up for grabs, and Southgate has selected five other centre-backs over the past 12 months, suggesting who is under consideration.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Marc Guehi</strong> and <strong>Levi Colwill </strong>- stars for the U21s in recent years - appear to be the next in line, while <strong>Ezri Konsa</strong>, <strong>Tyrone Mings</strong> and<strong> Lewis Dunk</strong> have also been tried. Guehi will miss the upcoming international break with injury but is expected to be in contention for the Euros, while Colwill has established himself as first choice left centre-back for Chelsea this season.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://e1.365dm.com/12/03/master/skysports-tosin-fulham-england_6488159.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Mings has been out with a long-term injury since the opening day of the season and will not be in the running, while Konsa has been playing at right-back for Aston Villa. So who else is there for Southgate to consider? What if England suffer a long-term injury or two? Should the likes of Tosin at least be in the conversation?</p>\n<p>Perhaps he should, given he is currently outperforming all of the above across several important statistical metrics in the Premier League - even Man City\'s Stones in some aspects.</p>\n<p>Tosin has won more defensive duels (67.37%), interceptions per 90 minutes (1.5) and clearances per 90 minutes (4.99) than all of them, and he also has more headed clearances per 90 minutes (3.33) than any other centre-back in the Premier League to have played more than four games.</p>\n<p>There are a couple of obvious skews in the data; the further down the league your team is, the more likely you are to be doing more defending in games, and Fulham have been competing in the bottom half all season. That will be among the reasons why Everton\'s centre-back pair <strong>James Tarkowski</strong> (1.79) and <strong>Jarrad Branthwaite</strong> (1.64) score more highly than any of England\'s centre-backs on interceptions per 90, while Branthwaite also edges Tosin on duel success by just 0.14 per cent.</p>\n<p>There is also the fact that Tosin spent the first half of the season out injured with a groin problem and has made 14 Premier League appearances since, which condenses and spikes his data, while the likes of Guehi, Colwill, Dunk, Konsa and the two Everton lads have played more than 20 games.</p>\n<p>But if you are using data to help select players then these are the main ingredients for a centre-back. As well as the England internationals, Tosin is outperforming Tarkowski (4.54) and Branthwaite (4.16) on clearances per 90 too. And apart from Stones, Tosin has also conceded the fewest fouls out of the England pool too - just six.</p>\n<p>Fulham manager Marco Silva has been singing his praises recently and mentioned the national team ahead of the weekend\'s defeat at Wolves: \"In December, when it was really busy, he helped the team to reach a really good level. He is a really important player for us inside the football club.</p> \n<p>\"He is growing. He is a really good player and of course we always expect better things from him, and if he is going to be the case to go for the national team (then) even better, because it\'s always the ambition of a football player.\"</p>\n<p>There is no doubt Tosin should be in the next group of players to be considered for a call-up if he continues in this vein and, at 26, he still has plenty of time to represent his country.</p>\n<p>And what about the likes of <strong>Max Kilman</strong>, also performing well at Wolves? He tops the clearance charts with 128 followed by Tarkowski on 127. His Everton team-mate Branthwaite is clearly another up-and-coming talent but he is only 21 and currently playing regularly for England\'s U21s.</p>\n<p>And what of the English players playing in Europe? <strong>Fikayo Tomori </strong>at AC Milan and<strong> Eric Dier </strong>at Bayern Munich? Tomori has just returned from injury that kept him out for a couple of months but he has impressed in Italy and played in the Champions League. Dier is a very similar a player to Maguire and you might say he is part of England\'s past rather than their future.</p> \n<p><strong>Watch Fulham vs Tottenham live on Sky Sports Premier League this Saturday from 5pm; kick-off 5.30pm</strong></p>', '2024-03-13 04:00:01', '2024-03-13 04:00:01', 'Fulham\'s Tosin: A wildcard pick for England?', 'https://e0.365dm.com/24/03/384x216/skysports-tosin-fulham_6488166.jpg?20240312155713', 'sports', 'https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13092821/tosin-adarabioyo-fulham-defender-is-outperforming-englands-centre-backs-so-is-he-an-option-for-euro-2024', 'Fulham centre-back Tosin is in the midst of some of his best form - is he a wildcard option for England at Euro 2024?', 'football'),

For every thrilling shootout against hardened space pirates, theres a protracted struggle in remembering how to merely travel between locations - a problem borne of maps at planetary, system, and galactic scales, with confusing layouts. There are even contradictions in basic controls, such as being able to pick up some objects while youre in the scanner view, but others that force you to return to normal view to grab.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Still, perhaps some of this is unavoidable for a game of the sheer size and ambition of <em>Starfield</em>. There are side features here of such complexity that they could conceivably form entire games in their own right, such as building outposts or constructing starships. These are aspects that you could sink further dozens of hours into on their own merits, requiring their own set of controls and rulesets to operate, and that almost by necessity create some clashes with how other parts of the game work. The core problem is that Bethesda so poorly explains pivotal aspects of the game to players.

Alongside a spectacularly detailed character creator allowing you to blend races, classes, physical attributes, and more from <em>D&amp;D\'s</em> multitudinous options are seven Origin characters  pre-made protagonists with their own backgrounds and agendas. Standouts include Shadowheart, a haughty half-elf straight out of <em><a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/mean-girls-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Mean Girls</a></em>; Astarion, a high elf rogue who\'s (supposedly) kicked old vampiric habits; and Karlach, a demonic barbarian escaped from hell who just wants to find love  and vengeance. Thankfully, these pivotal figures can become companions if not actively played, so you\'ll still get to experience their stories without multiple playthroughs.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>That\'s a minor blessing, as <em>Baldur\'s Gate III</em> almost has too much content for even a single run. Developer Larian boasts 174 hours of cinematics alone (thankfully, that figure is reached via some creative accounting, as it includes variant scenes that differ depending on choices made or characters present), while every problem has numerous outcomes, splintering paths into near-infinite directions.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>For instance, on a first playthrough, shortly after escaping the crashed nautiloid ship that you initially wake up on, we found a locked door to an ancient vault. Failing a skill check to lockpicking, there was no choice but to move on, soon meeting Gale, a wizard and fellow Mindflayer escapee who joins up with you. In a later pass though, we succeeded in picking the lock, revealing a mausoleum dedicated to a dead god, filled with loot, an important side character, and a battle against undead librarians. Fighting our way through to a hidden exit on the other side, we then encountered a bunch of thieves trying to raid a different tomb, and the path splintered further with various options of how to approach.(Attack them from afar? After all, two of them are arguing right under an abandoned counterweight that could take them out with a well-placed fire bolt to its supporting rope Or maybe intimidate them into leaving the site, allowing you to raid its treasures instead? Charming them to win their favour could work too)</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"Baldur\'s Gate 3\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/bg3-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/bg3-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/bg3-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/bg3-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/bg3-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/bg3-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/bg3-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Whatever you choose, the story warps, morphs, adapts; new routes and outcomes come into being in real time, mutating the shape of not just the current quest, but the game as a whole. There are characters you may never meet (or, if you\'re an unlucky thief under a cinderblock, may kill off before meeting them, cutting off any possible later encounters) or quests you never unlock. A seemingly innocent dialogue choice may royally piss off a party member, affecting how they react to you at apivotal moment later. It\'s inconceivable you\'ll ever see all that <em>Baldur\'s Gate III</em> has to offer, but that\'s part of the beauty  it\'s a completely different experience for each and every player.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>While that may be no huge surprise to anyone who played the similarly divergent <a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/baldur-gate-1-2-enhanced-editions/\" target=\"_blank\">original <em>Baldur\'s Gate</em> games</a>, this isn\'t just more of the same, albeit in current-gen quality. Perhaps the biggest change Larian has brought about is a shift to turn-based combat, a first for the series. While it\'s all underpinned by <em>D&amp;D\'s</em> tabletop Fifth Edition ruleset, don\'t worry if you\'ve not memorised the pen-and-paper game\'s arcane systems.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>At its simplest here, you\'ll position each character on their turn, then choose what action to take. It\'s easy enough to grasp without having to worry about stat modifiers or the series\' typical number wrangling, but for those who do know (or care) about the difference between a spell and a cantrip, or how a +1 to attack can turn the tide of battle, there\'s plenty of depth and specificity to be found in combat. As you get to grips with the game, you\'ll begin to pick out how you can make use of turn order, or bonus actions, or environmental attacks to better dominate each encounter. Throwing some grease on the ground, then setting it on fire, <em>then</em> dipping a weapon in that fire is a great way to control the battlefield and enhance your attacks, for example.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"Baldur\'s Gate 3\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/bg3-3.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/bg3-3.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/bg3-3.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/bg3-3.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/bg3-3.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/bg3-3.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/bg3-3.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Instead of throwing an endless stream of numbers at you in combat, the stats side of <em>D&amp;D</em> is found in those aforementioned skill checks that kick in at pivotal branching moments. Whether it\'s picking a lock, disarming a trap, investigating a suspicious monument, or even making certain dialogue choices, you\'ll click a digital d20 to roll against a relevant skill. Any modifiers available  items or skills that improve or worsen the score  are immediately factored in. Roll high enough to meet the requirements and you\'ll unlock it. Fail, and you\'ll have to come up with another solution for the particular problem, or live with the consequences. It\'s a great approach, making the nerdy skill checks visual and intuitive, while making combat less dominated by unseen background numbers.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>If there\'s a downside to <em>Baldur\'s Gate III</em>, it\'s the decidedly sub-par joypad controls. You can almost imagine Larian grumbling at having to add the control scheme in for the PS5 release, all the while cursing the lack of an official mouse for Sony\'s behemoth of a console (then, even <em>more</em> grudgingly, porting those controls back to the PC version as an option). There are parts that work: chiefly, moving your character around the world with the DualSense thumbstick feels far more natural than constantly clicking or holding the left mouse button to direct them to a particular spot on PC, while also manually moving the camera to track them. However, the rest of the controls get mapped to a multitude of radial dials, which is far from intuitive  panning back and forth between them trying to find the particular skill or action you want to use can be a slightly frustrating chore. But given the sheer volume of spells and abilities on offer for your various characters, it\'s hard to see what an obvious alternative might have been.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>While its sheer scale may also be a shade daunting to newcomers to this particular style of RPG, <em>Baldurs Gate III</em> offers a truly epic experience like almost no other, one packed with meaningful choices at every turn. Like a great Dungeon Master leading an epic tabletop role-playing session, Larian ensures everything here exists in service to storytelling, to allowing players to carve their own path through the world. Even the smallest decisions  whether to kill a monster, free a prisoner, or to join up with a handsome but obviously shady wizard  can have meaningful consequences, and failure at any point can often lead to something even more interesting. Forget the genres tendency for stat-wrangling and juggling numbers  its in that unrivalled freedom that <em>Baldurs Gate III</em> earns its place as an RPG for the ages. A modern masterpiece.</p>\n</span>', '2024-03-13 05:00:01', '2024-03-13 05:00:01', 'Baldurs Gate III Review', 'https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/bg3-1.jpg?ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=top&auto=format&w=1440&q=80', 'movies', 'https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/baldurs-gate-iii/', 'Platforms: PS5, PC Its safe to say Dungeons &amp; Dragons is having a...', 'gaming'),

Set in a fantasy world caught in the grip of an endless conflict over control of magic  see, familiar ground already  you play as snarky street urchin Jak. No, not the pointy-eared fella who palled around with Daxter back on the PS2, but a Triarch, one of the rare few who can control all three varieties of magic that infuse Aveum. Said magic manifests as mystic gunfire through equippable and customisable sigils  blue mana serves as your ranged weapon; red is your shotgun, inaccurate but powerful up close; green a rapid-fire machine gun  and the whole affair plays out in first-person.</p>\n</span><div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__ynq1g\" data-test=\"pullquote\">\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__icon__JGpkh\"><span></span></div>\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__content__gRuai\">\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There\'s some surprisingly strong writing that subverts the game\'s more generic elements.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Thankfully, there\'s some surprisingly strong writing that subverts the game\'s more generic elements. When Jak is recruited into the armies of Lucium by General Kirkan  Gina Torres, selling the hell out of even the most ridiculous mysti-babble  even he expects him to be at the start of a Chosen One journey, only for a rather brilliantly-timed Five Years Later time-skip to undercut his, and our, expectations. We rejoin him having spent a half-decade waging a war of attrition against Lucium\'s enemies, jaded but more confident for the experience. Similarly, the overarching plot frequently draws into question whether the titular Immortals  Lucium\'s elite forces, who Jak eventually joins  are truly in the right, or whether (ludicrously named) arch-enemy Sandrakk may have a point in his actions to end the everwar.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Between those moments of deeper insight and narrative focus, though, are extended sections of shooting that are likely to be familiar territory to many players. <em>Immortals</em> tries to mix things up with an alignment system requiring you to target colour-coded enemies with matching sigil blasts  bruising red enemies are best dealt with through your own potent red magic, and likewise for blue and green foes  and various shielding or health buff techniques on enemies parts that can be impeded by countering their particular affinity. To its credit, this can result in some frenetic moments when you have a variety of enemies of different alignments attacking you at once, but too often it all just feels like an RGB shooting gallery, especially against bosses that are often telegraphed with, Shoot the green bit!

While much has been made of its creative lineage linking it to some of the biggest FPS titles in recent memory  chiefly through director Bret Robbins\' work on the <em><a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii/\" target=\"_blank\">Call Of Duty</a></em> series  it often feels closer to something like <em><a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/metroid-prime-remastered/\" target=\"_blank\">Metroid Prme</a></em>. Or rather, <em>Metroid Prime</em> without the tight level design and laser-focused sense of progression. As players explore Aveum, they\'ll encounter environmental obstacles such as anchor points to rappel up using an upgraded whip, translucent forcefields blocking off tantalising bonus areas, or mounds of poisonous sludge hindering progression, all beckoning you back once Jak has the requisite spell to overcome them, all a textbook example of the Metroidvania subgenre. Unfortunately, it\'s slightly let down by <em>Immortals</em> spacious, if not fully open-world approach to environmental design, which in conjunction with an iffy system of only semi-accessible fast-travel portals scattered around the world makes returning to mop up collectibles feel more chore than scintillating objective.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p><em>Immortals</em>\' biggest problem though is its oft-woeful performance. On Xbox Series X (version tested), texture pop-in was common, and character models in cutscenes  which drop the first-person perspective for a more cinematic third-person approach  would frequently judder, even when standing in place. In the midst of firefights, where Jak\'s mana-powered blasts result in boundless particle effects, slowdown was notable. It\'s a real shame, as Aveum\'s world and approach to character design are beautiful, but let down by the shoddy output.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Despite all this though  the mix-and-match magic, the generic shooting, the performance  there\'s something almost cozy about playing <em>Immortals</em>. That same familiarity that makes much of it feel like a taster\'s platter of every high fantasy film or game of the last 40 years also allows you to slip right into the world, get the gist of what\'s going on, and get to work blasting away Sandrakk\'s forces. It\'s undemanding entertainment, and while it\'s unlikely to be troubling any Game Of The Year lists come December, it\'s fun enough to make your way through for a couple of dozen hours and then forget.</p>\n</span>', '2024-03-13 05:00:01', '2024-03-13 05:00:01', 'Immortals Of Aveum Review', 'https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/09/immortals-of-aveum-1.jpg?ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=top&auto=format&w=1440&q=80', 'movies', 'https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/immortals-of-aveum/', 'Platforms: Xbox Series X|S, PS5, PC EAs reputation for relying on...', 'gaming');

As warring corporations bicker over the rights to mine it, your silent protagonist (the catchily-monikered C4-621) begins life as a merc, taking on corporate interests while clashing with the RLF (Rubicon Liberation Front) and the PCA (Planetary Closure Administration think military-grade bailiffs, only with orbital laser batteries instead of bolt cutters).</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Disappointingly, the story plays out almost entirely through mission briefings, with narrative taking a clear back-seat to action here. Happily, though, the frenetic third-person gameplay more than picks up the slack. Your AC is quick and highly manoeuvrable despite its gargantuan size, with the ability to skate around on jets, quick-boost out of danger and even fly towards your enemies at thunderous speed (for as long as your energy reserves will allow). There is an almost balletic quality to the war machines movement as you learn to engage enemy forces both on the ground and in the air. Your AC has four primary weapons  one in each hand and a pair mounted on shoulders  with independent buttons for each, and learning to use all of these in concert, while attacking and evading in three-dimensional space, is an initially daunting task. But learn it you must, and learn it fast, because in keeping with FromSoftwares pedigree, hard-as-nails boss battles drop in at regular intervals, providing skill checks that wont let you progress until the challenge is met.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/ARMORED-CORE-VIa.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/ARMORED-CORE-VIa.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/ARMORED-CORE-VIa.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/ARMORED-CORE-VIa.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/ARMORED-CORE-VIa.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/ARMORED-CORE-VIa.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/ARMORED-CORE-VIa.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Unlike the <em>Souls</em> games, however, bosses in <em>Armored Core</em> are less about learning and countering attack patterns than they are intricate combat puzzles in need of solving by experimentation with loadout.

The question of \"why now?\" for <em>Red Dead Redemption\'s</em> return largely goes unanswered.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/RDR1_Release_PS4_003-Large.jpeg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/RDR1_Release_PS4_003-Large.jpeg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/RDR1_Release_PS4_003-Large.jpeg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/RDR1_Release_PS4_003-Large.jpeg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/RDR1_Release_PS4_003-Large.jpeg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/RDR1_Release_PS4_003-Large.jpeg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/RDR1_Release_PS4_003-Large.jpeg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>It\'s even odder given that this isn\'t really any kind of remaster. Handled by Double Eleven Studios, there\'s no deep overhaul of the original\'s visuals, and while the 2010 classic was no slouch for the time, it\'s definitely showing its age a bit now. This release also strips out any multiplayer capabilities, so those 16-player shootouts and eight-player posses roaming the plains are lost to the past. There is at least a sizeable cheat menu available from the off, allowing you to tweak the game with modifiers such as \'Every Shot Counts\' or \'Clear Bounty\' if you want to shake off enemies hunting you down, but these come at the cost of disabling autosaving and achievements. That might give PlayStation players pause, but given the Switch doesn\'t support system-wide achievements, making the ones here merely in-game brownie points, who cares?</p>\n</span><div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__ynq1g\" data-test=\"pullquote\">\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__icon__JGpkh\"><span></span></div>\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__content__gRuai\">\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Red Dead Redemption remains one of Rockstar\'s finest offerings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>The Switch version in particular runs at 720p in handheld mode, but manages full 1080p HD when docked.

Its deeper themes  how difficult it is to break cycles of violence, how the powers that be may not want us to, how redemption for sins past may be forever out of reach  remain utterly compelling. The moments of emergent gameplay, be it whether to help a passerby, intervene in a lynching, or even just how to survive an unexpected ambush, make the world feel alive and unpredictable.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Even though <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> has presented an even more vivid and detailed Western for current gen hardware, it\'s great to have its predecessor still available, and especially so in portable form.

Pro-wrestling provides the framework for the world and story, following aspiring champ Randy Muchacho Man Santos  no points for guessing the inspiration  and established wrestler Brink Logan (more an homage to the likes of Bret \'Hitman\' Hart, right down to coming from an esteemed wrestling dynasty) on their own paths to glory, with plenty of puns and references along the way. RPGs provide the backbone of combat, with matches in the squared circle taking a turn-based approach, and exploration with a top-down pixel art aesthetic reminiscent of the likes of <em>Chrono Trigger</em> or <a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-pixel-remaster-collection/\" target=\"_blank\">earlier <em>Final Fantasy</em></a> epics.</p>\n</span><div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__ynq1g\" data-test=\"pullquote\">\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__icon__JGpkh\"><span></span></div>\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__content__gRuai\">\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Certain key choices see you edging towards being a face or a heel to the audience.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Although the turn-based battles here aren\'t as intricate as the likes of <em><a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-into-reverie/\" target=\"_blank\">Trails Into Reverie</a></em>, they\'re not an entirely stripped-back trading of blows either, with quick-time prompts for attacks and counters more than capable of turning the tide of any match. While it\'ll all still feel familiar to fans of classic JRPGs, the combat system is brilliantly reshaped in pro-wrestling\'s image. Forget spells; here you have gimmicks, the signature moves of each character, such as Muchacho Man\'s South of the Border Stunner piledriver, or teacher doll Barbae\'s Chemistry Class that sets all rivals on fire. Summons are gone, replaced by calling on your manager for some ringside interference, while party attacks are  of course  elaborate tag team moves. And, although regular battles against grunts can be won by simply depleting enemy health, rival wrestlers must be pinned with a three count, a nice twist that keeps the wrestling motif front and centre.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>The RPG factor extends beyond battles too. It\'s found in character customisations, with upgradeable body parts affecting the stats for each of your action figure heroes. It\'s a clever touch that leans into the toybox fantasy of the game, with wrestlers that can be kit-bashed with parts found from other toys. Choices in smack talk before key matches can also impact enemy motivation ahead of battles, and you can even customise your entry walks and music for maximum hype  hype itself an important factor in keeping the crowd riled up in your favour. There\'s even a very basic morality system, where certain key choices see you edging towards being a face or a heel to the audience.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"WrestleQuest\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/wrestlequest-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/wrestlequest-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/wrestlequest-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/wrestlequest-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/wrestlequest-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/wrestlequest-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https//images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/wrestlequest-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p><em>WrestleQuest</em> does rely a little too heavily on its central schtick though, almost to the extent that the constant barrage of pro-wrestling gags and references begin to feel like a sticking plaster over a lack of polish. There\'s a half-hearted attempt to feature spoken dialogue, but only in the form of the same potted lines repeated ad nauseum whenever you speak to supporting characters, regardless of the actual on-screen text. Then there are a few too many half-baked mini-games scattered throughout, such as a <em>Dance Dance Revolution</em>-style one that borrows the aesthetic  directional arrows rising while club music plays  but not the mechanics, with no connection to the rhythm or beats of the music itself.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Certain aspects of the game are poorly explained too, such as those aforementioned tag team moves. Each character involved in a move needs to learn the skill separately before you can use it in battle, but this is never detailed. The result being, you\'ll see one character gain a gimmick when levelling up, then see no sign of it in the ring until the corresponding partner also gains it, which seemingly happens at random.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Despite this, <em>WrestleQuest</em> packs in plenty of charm across its 30-odd hour saga, and it\'s hard not to get on board with its often glorious cheesiness. It\'s also a far more original approach to adapting wrestling to video games than making yet another standard grappler. Those with nostalgia for the particular era of both the sport and the RPGs its homaging will get more from the game, though.</p>\n</span>', '2024-03-13 05:00:01', '2024-03-13 05:00:01', 'WrestleQuest Review', 'https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/08/wrestlequest-1.jpg?ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=top&auto=format&w=1440&q=80', 'movies', 'https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/wrestlequest/', 'Platforms: PC, Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S Hey brother!

Not only does it mark the return of the developers trademark episodic stories (here in a team-up up with <em>Life Is Strange: True Colours</em> Deck Nine Games), but it also sees the return of one of televisions stand-out sci-fi series, <em>The Expanse</em>, which finished its six season run on Prime Video last year.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Based on the novels by James S.A.

Given the depth and scope of both show and novels, it will come as some relief to the uninitiated that you need little more knowledge than that to jump straight in to Telltales latest adventure. Rather than pick up where the show ended, the game is a prequel revolving around one of the series supporting (and fan-favourite) characters, no-nonsense Belter Camina Drummer (superbly voiced here by series actor Cara Gee) during her days as XO of the salvage ship Artemis. In true televisual style, were dropped immediately into the meat of the story via a cold open that sees Drummer poised to fire her erstwhile captain Cox, a ruthless Earther, who lives entirely up to his name  out an airlock, before winding the clock back a few days as the Artemis begins a mission sifting through the wreckage of a recently destroyed battleship, only to discover coordinates to a potentially huge score and end up in the crosshairs of a notorious Belter pirate.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"The Expanse: A Telltale Series\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/07/expanse-game-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/07/expanse-game-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/07/expanse-game-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/07/expanse-game-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/07/expanse-game-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/07/expanse-game-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/07/expanse-game-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>As with most Telltale games, <em>The Expanse</em> unfolds largely through narrative cutscenes, interspersed with occasional puzzles and binary conversation choices that often have far-reaching consequences (ominously signposted by [Character] will remember that). Aside from the occasional quick time event to make you feel involved, Telltale titles often feel like they largely play themselves and whether you enjoy simply being swept up in the story or find yourself wondering if you couldnt just as easily watch the entire game on YouTube largely comes down to personal taste. However, <em>The Expanse</em>, takes some steps to address that disconnect, being more interactive than much of Telltales catalogue. Regular third-person exploration sequences prevent you from feeling like a spectator, moreso for making the most of the games zero-g setting by not only allowing you to employ your mag-boots to walk on walls and ceilings recalling the vertiginous feel of Inceptions iconic corridor fight  but also letting you switch them off entirely to float about in a 360 degree environment. All of which keeps things fresh and interesting even when youre simply trekking from point A to B in order to trigger the next event. The games puzzles are simple enough that they wont keep you up at night, and the quick time windows are generous and rarely frustrating, meaning that the primary difficulty comes from forcing you to make difficult judgement calls under pressure. Do you save a haul of valuables but risk a crewmans life? Do you space your double-dealing captain or throw him in the brig? Its ethical conundrums rather than reflex-tests that form the backbone of <em>The Expanse</em>s challenge.</p>\n</span><div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__ynq1g\" data-test=\"pullquote\">\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__icon__JGpkh\"><span></span></div>\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__content__gRuai\">\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For long-time <em>Expanse</em> fans, the entire experience is a giddy delight</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>But, odd as it might seem for a video game, actual gameplay is secondary here. What attracts people to Telltale titles is narrative and the storytelling in <em>The Expanse</em> is as tight as youd hope from a title that bears the name. Even if this is your first foray into the <em>Expanse</em> universe, youll warm to Drummer: a woman of contradictions whose unflinching, ruthless pragmatism belies a big heart, fierce loyalty and a wary distrust of anyone outside the Belt. And while her peculiar Belter patois might take some getting used to (uninitiated players will learn to tell their inyas from their beltalowda quick enough), the richness of the setting speeds the adjustment, with the initial episode doing an admirable job of introducing both Drummer and her crew. An abrasive, often hostile bunch who ultimately form the beating heart of this five-part saga, the interactions, frictions, and shifting loyalties of the Artemis dysfunctional family lend the story real emotional heft, forcing you to care about all of them, from idiotic Belter brothers Arlen and Rayen, to gruff pilot Khan and furtive medic Virgil, who harbours a murky past. Navigating these relationships via simple dialogue choices might seem reductive but having a tangible stake in the characters development  and fate!  deftly sucks you in, making those split-second life or death choices land with the weight of a full 10G burn.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>For long-time <em>Expanse</em> fans, the entire experience is a giddy delight, not only providing a way back into that cherished universe, but revealing it though the eyes of a beloved character who didnt get nearly enough screen time during the shows run. Allowing viewers to get better acquainted with Drummer feels like a gift, Gees exemplary performance combined with sharp, athentic writing providing a new dimension on the character and establishing the game as something that could easily have been a spin-off prequel miniseries. The main criticism is that its all over far too quickly. With each of the five episodes clocking in at between an hour and an hour and a half (largely depending on how fastidious you are at ferreting out every last point of interest) its not a long game  even if the nature of the branching story does encourage return visits. In this case the staggered release may work in its favour, drawing out the experience and allowing players to savour the story, series-style, rather than binge it all in a single sitting. With twists, shocks and heartbreak aplenty, theres a great deal here to relish.</p>\n</span>', '2024-03-13 05:00:01', '2024-03-13 05:00:01', 'The Expanse: A Telltale Series Review', 'https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/07/expanse-game-2.jpg?ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=top&auto=format&w=1440&q=80', 'movies', 'https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/the-expanse-a-telltale-series/', 'Platforms: PC, PS4/5, Xbox Arriving piecemeal over the next two months, this...', 'gaming');

Like previous games, each breed of Pikmin has distinct attributes that help navigate the world and survive its threads. Red Pikmin are invulnerable to fire, for instance, allowing them to cross burning terrain and take on flame-spewing enemies. Yellow ones are similarly immune to electricity but also capable diggers, while Blues can wade through water unfazed. Strong Purple, durable Rock, speedy Winged, and poisonous White Pikmin all make their return too, with their own strengths and weaknesses to master.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Only this time, that\'s all just the intro. For most of the game, you\'re not playing as Olimar, but rather a new recruit to the wider Rescue Corps  and in a series first, your player character is customisable, with a decent suite of options in keeping with the game\'s cute aesthetic. As part of a squad chasing Olimar\'s distress signal, you\'ve ended up crash landing as well, with crew members left scattered across the planet. Each in-game day sees you venturing out into uncharted territory to rescue the crew, recover other castaways, and look for clues to Olimar\'s whereabouts, racing the clock to achieve as much as possible before sundown.</p>\n</span><div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__ynq1g\" data-test=\"pullquote\">\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__icon__JGpkh\"><span></span></div>\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__content__gRuai\">\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Pikmin 4</em> refines everything that previously worked in the series, improves what didn\'t, and adds a host of new content and play modes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>It\'s slow going to start with  possibly too slow for some, with Nintendo opting for some incredibly intrusive handholding early on, interrupting play every few minutes with a forced bit of dialogue or explanation for stuff even newcomers would have figured out  but as <em>Pikmin 4</em> lets players off the leash, it blossoms into an incredibly rich and rewarding experience. A mix of returning and brand new features build out the game, such as explorable caves making a reappearance for the first time since <em>Pikmin 2</em>. These subterranean mazes are packed with puzzles to solve, bosses to vanquish, and treasures to find, and sometimes navigating a cave is the only way to reach new areas in the overworld, making everywhere feel more connected and intricately designed.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Elsewhere, each crew member rescued opens up extra features in a hub area, from scientist Russ cooking up protective kit or gadgets such as bombs that can help combat enemies or speed up exploration, to doctor Yonny, who unlocks new night-time expeditions. These nocturnal missions provide one of <em>Pikmin 4\'s</em> best new features, a twist on tower defence games where you\'ll need to guard \"Luminknolls\" from dusk \'til dawn, with only the new Glow Pikmin to aid you. These bioluminescent creatures only come out after dark, but prove more than capable of holding off hungry enemies through the night, so long as you tactically manage where and how to deploy them.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"Pikmin 4\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/07/pikmin-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/07/pikmn-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/07/pikmin-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/07/pikmin-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/07/pikmin-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/07/pikmin-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/07/pikmin-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Another new Pikmin species, Ice Pikmin  which can float and freeze bodies of water they\'re thrown into  also impacts how you\'ll approach survival during the day, but <em>Pikmin 4\'s</em> biggest difference to its predecessors is the introduction of Oatchi, a bipedal dog-like \'Rescue Pup\'. Like Pikmin, Oatchi can carry objects and attack enemies, but also has a host of dedicated skills that affect how you explore. The pupper can sniff out hidden treasure, helping track down collectibles you may have missed, and has a powerful and versatile Rush attack, used for shattering obstacles, shaking collectibles loose, or charging enemies. Both your player character and your current swarm of Pikmin can ride on Oatchi\'s back too, which allows you to jump up otherwise unpassable ledges and, as Oatchi grows and learns to swim, ferry Pikmin that would normally drown across water. Given you\'re typically limited to three types of Pikmin in your squad at any one time, it\'s a nice way of being able to play around with how and where you deploy your helpers.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>You\'ll also be able to switch to controlling Oatchi directly. Sometimes you\'ll be forced to, sending them through a pipe to reach a distant switch, or if a cave level deliberately separates you. Other times, you\'ll want to take direct control to better or more accurately assault enemies. Learning when and how best to use Oatchi\'s abilities is a key skill in <em>Pikmin 4</em>, and can drastically impact how successfully each day\'s rescue efforts go.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Through it all though, it\'s <em>Pikmin 4\'s</em> dedication to Dandori that is the most pivotal shift. What\'s Dandori? Simply put, a philosophy of efficient planning, here integrated as gameplay mechanic that can drastically ratchet up the difficulty. Dandori Battles are special caves that will test your abilities to manage Pikmin to their limits, charging you with gathering more items and doing it faster than a \"Leafling\" rival, while Dandori Challenges give you a strict time limit to defeat enemies and grab a set number of items. Both types can be extremely tough, representing some of the most difficult moments in the series\' history, but they\'re all so meticulously designed that you can\'t help but appreciate them.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Those dedicated Dandori levels are ultimately about testing time and resource management skills, working out whether it\'s best to tackle <em>that</em> enemy or clear <em>this</em> obstacle first, and figuring out how best to split your Pikmin forces to achieve those objectives. But they\'re also designed to change your thinking about the game as a whole, improving how you do all of those things in the wider game. <em>Pikmin\'s</em> strategy elements were always fairly low-key, but here they\'re fine-tuned to the extent that good Dandori practices can enhance how you explore each surface level, maximising the treasure recovered or castaways rescued each day.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>It\'s that degree of evolution that finally, two decades on, gives <em>Pikmin</em> its best shot yet at really clicking with players on a grander scale. <em>Pikmin 4</em> refines everything that previously worked in the series, improves what didn\'t, and adds a host of new content and play modes to elevate the whole package. It\'s still accessible to newcomers, but no longer so simple that it feels like \"My First RTS\". Hands down, this is the best <em>Pikmin</em> yet.</p>\n</span>', '2024-03-13 05:00:01', '2024-03-13 05:00:01', 'Pikmin 4 Review', 'https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/07/pikmin-3.jpg?ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=top&auto=format&w=1440&q=80', 'movies', 'https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/pikmin-4/', 'Platforms: Nintendo Switch Pikmin, as a franchise, is over twenty years old at...', 'gaming'),

Each match has both teams racing to complete objectives, before a final mission will either pit them directly against each other, or perhaps in an uneasy alliance against an even greater threat. Each of these initial objectives are essentially variations on the same theme (that theme being riotous battles against hordes of dinos), and thus struggle to radically change things up from match to match, but the PvP components brought in by the climax do, at least, bring an air of unpredictability to each game.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Better still, <em>Exoprimal</em>\'s combat is at once both gleefully cathartic, yet also robust enough for those who want to dig a little deeper into advanced battle strategy. While the basic action usually involves some form of pointing and shooting, hacking and slashing, or healing and building, the diverse range of exo-suits available (each slotting into one of three class types) not only folds in a healthy deal of combat variety, but an extra layer of team composition tactics, too.</p>\n</span><div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__ynq1g\" data-test=\"pullquote\">\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__icon__JGpkh\"><span></span></div>\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__content__gRuai\">\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Exoprimal</em> very much delivers on the scale and bombast of its delightfully absurd premise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Pairing the shield-deploying Tank Exosuit Roadblock with, for example, Witchdoctor  a Support Exosuit that can heal allies within a specific radius  is a great way to seriously beef up your team\'s defences, but there are plenty of other equally viable and interesting squad permutations that can be explored and practised together. The option to augment each Exosuit with different Modules (passive traits) and Rigs (secondary weapons) only widens that variety of play styles further, and you can even switch between suits on the fly  a smart feature that allows you to respond to the changing circumstances of each battle as they unfold.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>It also helps that <em>Exoprimal</em> very much delivers on the scale and bombast of its delightfully absurd premise. Much like in Capcom\'s <em>Dead Rising</em> series, the sheer number of enemies that can spill onto the screen at once is a genuinely riveting spectacle. Pachycephalosaurs pour from the city skylines in unholy waterfalls of scales and claws, pteranodons cascade into deadly hurricanes fierce enough to put <em>Sharknado</em> to shame, and mutated neosaurs contort and combust in fits of multi-dimensional madness.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"Exoprimal\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/07/exoprimal-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/07/exoprimal-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/07/exoprimal-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/07/exoprimal-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/07/exoprimal-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/07/exoprimal-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/07/exoprimal-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>When all of its elements come together in the height of battle, <em>Exoprimal</em> is absoluely bonkers. And while the visuals aren\'t exactly industry-leading, there\'s impressive production value to the carnage, with the game holding up at a steady framerate even as legions of dinosaurs conquer the screen. It\'s worth noting that you won\'t be able to experience any of this, however, without a dedicated online connection <em>and</em> a registered Capcom account linked to your platform of choice; a rather annoying wrinkle that only draws more attention to the fact that <em>Exoprimal</em> has no single player campaign to speak of.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>That\'s a shame, given the potential of what could have been, but also something of an eye-raiser, since the game is retailing for a full 50/$60. And with only one multiplayer mode to speak of at the time of writing, the sense of <em>Exoprimal</em> being a little content-light at launch is one that\'s hard to shake. Still, what\'s here is solid entertainment for the time being, and a decent start for what Capcom is envisioning as a long-term live service.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p><em>Exoprimal</em> was always going to be compared in the shadow of Capcom\'s <em>other</em> dino-hunting series, <em>Dino Crisis</em>, especially given that fans have been clamouring for a new title in that beloved franchise for some time. Nevertheless, the publisher\'s decision to try something different may just about satiate those fans for now, offering not quite a spiritual successor, or even a spin-off, but certainly a decent dino-adjacent companion piece  one that riffs on the same conflict between humans and history\'s deadliest predators, albeit at a very different scale.

Why is Flag Man grabbing a flying hammer such a big deal?</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p><em>Trails Into Reverie</em>is the<em>Avengers: Endgame</em>of this long-running JRPG franchise. If you\'ve been following the series since 2004\'s<em>Trails in the Sky</em>, this is the rousing end to a saga that\'s run for nearly two decades, tying together long-running plot threads and seeing major characters from previous entries crossing paths and teaming up. It\'s video gaming catharsis, the ultimate pay-off. If you\'ve not, you\'ll be utterly lost  but for fans of classic turn-based role-playing games, there\'s still a good time to be had here.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/trails-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/trails-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/trails-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/trails-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/trails-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/trails-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/trails-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Set in a fantasy world that blends technology and magic,<em>Reverie</em>kicks off with what would, in most games, be the finale  a cadre of seasoned warriors attacking the big bad\'s headquarters in a last ditch effort to liberate their homeland, Crossbell. Led by the heroic Lloyd Bannings, it\'s a thrilling opener to the game but also serves as a reminder of just how far into the wider story we are. To developer Nihon Falcom\'s credit, recaps of the previous games can be read from the menu, but while they prove handy for returning players needing refreshers, they can\'t replicate the scale, the ambition, the narrative grandeur of the series.</p>\n</span><div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__ynq1g\" data-test=\"pullquote\">\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__icon__JGpkh\"><span></span></div>\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__content__gRuai\">\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Puts paid to the idea that turn-based can\'t be thrilling, tactical, or skilful.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p><em>Reverie</em>continues that incredibly ambitious trajectory of its predecessors, with a twisting tale of empires rising and falling, the people caught up in the throes of war, and those willing to fight for freedom. After the intro chapter, the story splits into three paths  one following Lloyd, one for Rean Schwarzer, protagonist of the_Trails In Cold Steel_tetralogy, and one introducing C, a mysterious masked figure. You\'ll generally be able to swap between the trio of protagonists at any point, barring occasional gates that require you be at a certain point in the wider story for everyone to proceed. Switching focus is a great approach for a story of this scale, affording different perspectives on overlapping events, and conveying the world-changing stakes of what\'s unfolding, and even those coming in blind will shortly be swept up, even if there are so many characters and pre-existing relationships to keep track of that you\'ll need a whiteboard.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Yet just as<em>Reverie</em>expects players have familiarity with the world and politics it\'s exploring, so too does it presume some experience with its battle system  characters start the game at level 100, with powerful abilities already available to them that reflect their journeys in prior games. Thankfully, muddling through with a basic grasp of turn-based mechanics will see even neophytes through early sections, while the occasional tutorial does at least introduce combat features that are new to this entry.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/trails-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/trails-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/trails-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/trails-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/trails-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/trails-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/trails-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>It\'s worth persevering with<em>Trails\'</em>battle system though, as once you\'ve come to grips with it, it shows itself to be the pinnacle of turn-based combat. While former JRPG standard bearer<a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-xvi/\"><em>Final Fantasy</em></a>hs spent years distancing itself from the forms and conventions of the genre it helped popularise  at least in the west  the<em>Trails</em>series has leaned into them, honing them to a sharp edge. If you\'ve never dabbled with the series before, the basics will be clear enough  choosing between physical attacks and magic arts each turn is self-explanatory, but<em>Trails</em>then layers many more nuanced systems on top of the \"I hit, you hit\" model. For instance, using magic usually isn\'t instant  a character will have to actually cast the spell, costing a few spaces on the turn order. While this might mean an enemy gets a few licks in, cannily controlling that turn order means one of your party members\' turns might fall on fixed bonus, such as zero energy costs or a free heal, bonuses that would have otherwise gone to a foe if<em>their</em>turn fell on it. Then there are Crafts, special attacks that activate instantly but which cost CP that is only earned from taking or dealing damage, and Battle Orders, commands that can be issued to the entire party for a variety of stat boosts.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p><em>Reverie</em>also makes exciting use of its expansive cast. Across its three paths, the game features over 50 characters to form parties with, some of which have variable roles in battles that can be switched mid-fight  military academy student Juna can instantly swap between being a ranged gunner or an up-close striker, for example. Combat Links, where characters are paired in battle and the closeness of their bond can activate automatic defence, healing, or counter-attack moves, can also be changed on the fly, incentivising building bonds between as many characters as possible. Elsewhere, the new United Front feature allows you to utilise your entire roster, including supporting characters, for massive, cinematic attacks. The more you put into<em>Trails\'</em>combat, the more you\'ll get out, and the more satisfying you\'ll find it  it puts paid to the idea that turn-based can\'t be thrilling, tactical, or skilful.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>It\'s a shame then that so much of the game\'s brilliance will be lost on newer players. With<em>Trails into Reverie</em>being the first in the franchise to see release on PS5 (version tested), it\'s likely to bring fresh eyes to the series, making it all the more unfortunate that it is in no way an entry point. And, much like<em>Endgame</em>setting the stage for the MCU\'s ongoing Multiverse Saga,<em>Reverie</em>ultimately lays the groundwork for what comes next, with two more<em>Trails</em>games already out in Japan set to make their way westwards. For those who\'ve done their homework, this is a phenomenal effort  the highpoint in an epic thats been decades in the making, and worthy of adding a star to the score. If you\'ve not though, this is going to feel bewilderingly impenetrable.</p>\n</span>', '2024-03-13 05:00:01', '2024-03-13 05:00:01', 'The Legend of Heroes: Trails Into Reverie Review', 'https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/trails-3.jpg?ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=top&auto=format&w=1440&q=80', 'movies', 'https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-into-reverie/', 'Platforms: PS5, PS4, Nintendo Switch We can probably all agree...', 'gaming'),

We are <em>leaving</em>! Michael Biehns Corporal Hicks had the right idea when, after straying into the heart of the xenomorph hive in 1986s <em><a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/aliens-review/\">Aliens</a></em> and losing half his platoon to snapping, translucent jaws, he bellows a retreat. Cut off from escape and stripped of almost all their ammo, the surviving marines stage a desperate rearguard action, hoping against hope that the armoured personnel carrier can break through before theyre entirely overwhelmed. Its one of the most intense sequences in James Camerons seminal sequel, but in <em>Aliens: Dark Descent</em>, this frighteningly regular occurrence is just another glorious day in the corps.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p><em>Aliens</em> has not had a storied history when it comes to video game adaptations. While <em>Alien: Isolation</em> did a stand-up job of recreating Ridley Scotts original film, and 2001s <em>Aliens vs Predator 2</em> made a decent fist of that franchise mash-ups cross-species brawl, only decidedly average co-op shooter <em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite</em> has come even close to capturing the mood and feel of Camerons film. Its to the enormous credit of French developer Tindalos (<em>Battlefleet Gothic: Armada</em>) then, that this curious blend of survival horror, turn-based tactics and real-time strategy does exactly that. From the mid-eighties aesthetic of the computer interface, to slow-pans through the steel-panelled corridors of the USS Otago  complete with lumbering powerloaders  every detail of the game is lifted almost perfectly from the movie. As your marines disembark from their ARC (a more compact recon variant of the films APC) amidst howling wind and lashing rain to investigate the deserted colony of Dead Hills, it feels for all the world like youre stepping directly into the USMC-issue boots of Vasquez, Hudson et al as they make their first, ill-fated incursion into Hadleys Hope on LV-426  even if the events here take place nearly two decades later.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"Aliens: Dark Descent\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/AlienDarkDescent_SCREEN_4K_NoLogo_05-scaled.jpeg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/AlienDarkDescent_SCREEN_4K_NoLogo_05-scaled.jpeg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/AlienDarkDescent_SCREEN_4K_NoLogo_05-scaled.jpeg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/AlienDarkDescent_SCREEN_4K_NoLogo_05-scaled.jpeg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/AlienDarkDescent_SCREEN_4K_NoLogo_05-scaled.jpeg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/AlienDarkDescent_SCREEN_4K_NoLogo_05-scaled.jpeg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/AlienDarkDescent_SCREEN_4K_NoLogo_05-scaled.jpeg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>The game centres around Deputy Administrator Maeko Hayes, a Weyland-Yutani company woman who gets in way over her head when an alien outbreak leaves her and a ship full of Colonial Marines stranded on the planet Lethe. In-mission, though, Hayes is reduced to a voice on the radio as you guide a small squad of four marines through the gloom-shrouded corridors of colony buildings and, inevitably, the biomechanical hives of the aliens themselves. While the games closest comparison is Firaxis X_COM_ titles, <em>Dark Descent</em> opts for a real-time rather than turn-based format, allowing you to really feel the pressure as enemies descend, your motion tracker wailing desperate warnings. While your marines will lay down fire as soon as they spot an enemy, your survival  and sanity is maintained by the skill menu, which not only lets you to deploy special weapons and tactics like suppressing fire, flamethrowers and shotguns (for close encounters), but also slows time to a crawl, allowing you to micro-manage tactics without being completely overwhelmed by the xeno assault. Not that theres as much to manage as you might think:the RTS interface has been streamlined for the console generation, making it easily playable with a controller but also dumbing down the tactical options slightly. Your entire squad moves as a single, monolithic unit, with members (youll end up with gunners, medics, techs, recon marines and sergeants) stepping up to perform specific tasks like hacking doors or setting up sentry guns as and when required. Its a smart move and keeps you from having to corral lone marines who might otherwise wander off like wayward kittens, but does limit your ability to position personnel with any degree of accuracy.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>The simplicity of the control system is something to be thankful for when the shit hits the fan, though, as the game is brutally difficult even on the default setting, with ammo severely limited and save points set agonisingly far apart. Its a situation made even more punishing by the hive awareness timer, which advances every time you alert the aliens to your presence, and for sometime thereafter as they hunt for your team. At key milestones, the timer unleashes onslaughts, which see a massive swarm of aliens descend upon your position (you have around 20 seconds warning to dig in and prepare), as well as the arrival of powerful boss aliens. If that werent enough, the timer increases the overall difficulty inexorably as well, meaning that you can (and will) reach a point where your chances of survival dwindle to near zero. Luckily, its possible to exfiltrate at any given time, letting you bug out and call it even so you can lick your wounds, regroup, re-tool, and return the following day, the mission state enduring so you can pick up where you left off.</p>\n</span><div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__ynq1g\" data-test=\"pullquote\">\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__icon__JGpkh\"><span></span></div>\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__content__gRuai\">\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It\'s hard to overemphasise how much Dark Descent perfectly captures the aesthetic, atmosphere and claustrophobic dread of Cameron\'s film.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Time does not heal all wounds however, and, in a mechanic reminiscent of <em>Darkest Dungeon</em>, your Marines mental health can prove more fragile than their flesh. Too much stress during a mission can lead to debilitating psychological damage, leaving marines wit negative traits like pyrophobia or a susceptibility to panic, all of which adds to the steadily ratcheting difficulty, and must be managed between missions by the marine psychologist (in between building weapons and researching helpful tech upgrades in a strategic layer <em>XCOM</em> players will be very familiar with). While the unforgiving nature of the game is central to maintaining tension, its also an occasional source of frustration. Even a single alien drone can absorb enough damage to close on your squad before you take it down, which is harsh (and hardly in-keeping with cinematic fidelity) but fair enough. However, youll also face an assortment of human (and synthetic) opponents and its less clear why an angry stevedore armed with a shovel can absorb a similar level of bullet hail before grinding to a bloody halt.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Also, while the game is, by definition, a bug hunt, its dispiriting how regularly those of a non xenomorph variety turn up whilst playing. Glitches range from the purely cosmetic to the game-breaking (events failing to trigger, buttons becoming unresponsive, the skill menu turning almost unusably sluggish just when you need it the most) and its not uncommon to lose half an hour of progress because a malfunctioning game mechanic has stopped you in your tracks. Add to that woefully trite dialogue, hammy voice acting and rudimentary character models (fine when viewed form above on missions, clumsy marionettes when inspected up-close during cutscenes) and the game feels like it could have used a fair bit more polish before being released into the world.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>However, even taking all that on board, its hard to overemphasise how much <em>Dark Descent</em> perfectly captures the aesthetic, atmosphere and claustrophobic dread of the film. From the pop and crackle of the pulse rifles, to the perfectly replicated environments, and the Horner-lite musical cues, this is the closest anyones come to truly replicating the distinctive feel of <em>Aliens</em> outside a cinema. A love-letter to Camerons film, rather than a cynical license cash-in, <em>Dark Descent</em> does right by its source material. It delivers an immersive, nerve-jangling tactical horror game that allows you to credibly live out your dreams of enlisting in <em>Aliens</em> colonial marines_._ Its not a perfect game by any means, which is frustrating given its enormous potential, but even in this somewhat janky state, its worthy of your time. Stop your grinnin and drop your linen, because despite its shortcomings, this is hands-down the best <em>Aliens</em> adaptation so far.</p>\n</span>', '2024-03-13 05:00:01', '2024-03-13 05:00:01', 'Aliens: Dark Descent Review', 'https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/AlienDarkDescent_SCREEN_4K_NoLogo_01-scaled.jpeg?ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=top&auto=format&w=1440&q=80', 'movies', 'https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/aliens-dark-descent/', 'Platforms: PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X Marines!

Players have a few simple attacks at their disposal, alongside the trusty jump button, and that\'s it. In a platformer built around taut, dynamic level design, that makes perfect sense  but when transferred to the context of a chaotic PvP arena, these actions lose their sense of purity, and instead just feel inadequate. That unfortunately ends up leaving <em>Crash Team Rumble</em> as an experience marked largely by repetition, lack of balance, and surface-level conflict.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>In each match of <em>Crash Team Rumble</em> (and there is only one core match type), two teams of four players compete for Wumpa Fruit, which they must collect around the stage before banking at their base. Earning enough Wumpa Fruit wins you the game, but get killed by another member of the opposing team, and any fruit carried on your person (or creature) is lost to your slayer. It\'s a familiar format, but one that Toys For Bob does at least attempt to enrich via a roster of different playable characters, each with their own unique attacks and class-based traits, alongside environmental power-ups that can be acquired via special Relics found across the map.</p>\n</span><div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__ynq1g\" data-test=\"pullquote\">\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__icon__JGpkh\"><span></span></div>\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__content__gRuai\">\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A mostly chaotic free-for-all bereft of any strategic muscle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Unfortunately, these extra layers aren\'t enough to elevate <em>Crash Team Rumble</em> from playing like a mostly chaotic free-for-all bereft of any strategic muscle. This is largely a symptom of the combat itself, as hits never connect in a way that feel satisfying or even particularly accurate, often leaving you unsure as to which enemy you damaged at any one time. As a result, fights almost always descend into anarchic and unintelligible button-mashing, making it difficult to apply much in the way of tactical thinking to any encounter.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>And with most players typically gravitating towards the pandemonium of combat, anyone who wants to simply play the objective is usually free to do so quietly in the background. The result is that <em>Crash Team Rumble</em> is either a very simple collect-a-thon, a messy scrum of awkward slapstick, or a mixture of the two depending on your preference, yet none of these options hold much entertainment value beyond the first few hours of play.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"Crash Team Rumble\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/crash-team-rumble-3.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/crash-team-rumble-3.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/crash-team-rumble-3.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/crash-team-rumble-3.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/crash-team-rumble-3.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/crash-team-rumble-3.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/crash-team-rumble-3.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>The game\'s maps, at least, are vibrant and ful of colour, offering plenty of visual variety in their whistlestop tour across the <em>Bandicoot</em> universe (Bandi-verse?). And, aside from a surprisingly long entry queue every time you boot it up, <em>Crash Team Rumble</em> is notably well-optimised at launch, which is not something you can say for the majority of live service titles these days. Maintaining a smooth framerate that never buckles under the chaos of its brawls, the game\'s bright and welcoming production value is one of the best things about it.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Toys For Bob has already committed to supporting <em>Crash Team Rumble</em> long after launch with seasonal content, including new characters, maps, and premium battle passes full of cosmetics for those who want to make the extra purchase.

For now, this marsupial mash-up is fun for a few matches here and there, and will likely please the younger ones for even longer, but beyond that?

It\'s a <em>serious</em> <a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/features/100-best-video-games/\" target=\"_blank\">video game</a> for <em>serious</em> people, and it\'s <em>very</em> grown up  that\'s why <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em> has so many graphic, gory deaths of random soldiers, and why so many characters drop the f-bomb now. It\'s why  at various points exploring the world of Valisthea as Clive Rosfield, lost scion of a noble family  you\'ll occasionally find recipes for, um, butchering and cooking chocobos. Safe to say the latest entry in the long running series  the first core, numbered instalment in seven years  is a bit of a departure from form, then. Yet despite the dramatically different tone, director Hiroshi Takai has ensured that the essence, the <em>feel</em>, of <em>Final Fantasy</em> ultimately remains alive and well here.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Like most of its antecedents, <em>FF XVI</em> is, at its core, a tale of horrifying weapons and the abuse of unchecked power, stacked against the human cost of their usage. Here, the weapons of mass destruction are the series familiar elemental summons, rebranded Eikons (pronounced icons) and used by Valisthea\'s nations as they vie for power and territory. The power of an Eikon is channelled by a select few known as Dominants, with Clive\'s young brother Joshua the Dominant of the fiery Phoenix  until a mysterious second Eikon of Fire appears, Joshua is lost, and their powerful house falls, all in one fateful night. Years later, an embittered Clive searches for vengeance, but instead finds himself at the centre of a brewing rebellion against the corrupt forces that rule the world.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"Final Fantasy 16\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/ff16-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/ff16-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/ff16-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/ff16-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/ff16-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/ff16-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/ff16-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>If it all sounds a bit <em><a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/tv/reviews/game-thrones-season-1-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Game Of Thrones</a></em>, that\'s probably deliberate. From the return to a high fantasy approach  this is the first single-player, numbered <em>Final Fantasy</em> to embrace the aesthetic since <em>FF XII</em>  to a voice cast filled with northern English accents and politics that map a little too closely to those of Westeros, HBO\'s hit series seems to be a clear influence. Clive himself is more than a little reminiscent of Jon Snow, in both design and trajectory, and there\'s even a gentle giant of a supporting character you\'ll regularly cross paths with, all shades of Samwell Tarly with a touch of Hodor. Unfortunately, even <em>Game Of Thrones</em> offered more onscreen diversity than this does  Valisthea is whiter than a Winterfell Christmas, the entire world seeming to lack a single person of colour, even in crowds of background characters.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>It\'s not the first time <em>Final Fantasy</em> has pined after <em>GOT</em> though  Lena Headey and Sean Bean were both in the English voice cast for <em><a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-xv-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Final Fantasy XV</a></em>, and Ralph Ineson (<em>GOT\'s</em> Dagmer Cleftjaw) voices major character Cid here  but it\'s after the show\'s (perceived) maturity and darkness that Square Enix seems to have most modelled <em>FF XVI</em>, and the shift to a more adult attitude is matched with a shift in genre. <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em> has all but abandoned any pretence of being a role-playing game. Sure, Clive earns experience to level up and there are plenty of stat-altering trinkets to equip him with, but these factors feel more of like concessions to the series\' roots. At heart, this is an action game through and through.</p>\n</span><div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__ynq1g\" data-test=\"pullquote\">\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__icon__JGpkh\"><span></span></div>\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__content__gRuai\">\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The sheer spectacle is unrivalled.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Party members in the traditional <em>Final Fantasy</em> style are effectively an afterthought now  while Clive will occasionally be joined by others on his journey, they\'re entirely autonomous. These allies don\'t even take damage or require support, they\'re simply there to mop up grunts while you focus on tougher foes. The sole exception is Torgal, Clive\'s lupine familiar, who can be issued basic commands to attack or launch enemies into the air, or to deliver a very minor healing boost to Clive, but even this Very Good Boy is limited in his combat use.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>In some ways, this has been a long time coming for <em>Final Fantasy</em>  in <em>XV</em>, the rest of your party bar protagonist Noctis were only loosely commanded, while 2014\'s <em><a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/lightning-returns-final-fantasy-xiii-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII</a></em> also focused its combat entirely on the title character. While some may lament the change, <em>XVI\'s</em> battle system is phenomenal. Combat Director Ryota Suzuki  formerly of Capcom\'s <em>Devil May Cry</em> and <em>Dragon\'s Dogma</em> series  ensures even encounters with those aforementioned grunts are exciting, effervescent affairs. Blisteringly paced real-time combat sees Clive slashing out speedy sword attacks or channelling the power of Eikons into magic spells, zippily dodging enemy blows or leaping into the air to deliver crushing downward strikes. Battles against tougher foes involve chipping away at their Will Gauge, until they enter a stagger state allowing you to deal major damage, while boss fights are peppered with key dodges or strikes for added cinematic flair. The sheer spectacle is unrivalled, especially in some of the game\'s most brutal ordeals, fighting against Eikons themselves.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlneImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"Final Fantasy 16\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/ff16-3.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/ff16-3.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/ff16-3.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/ff16-3.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/ff16-3.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/ff16-3.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/ff16-3.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>The battle system is such a big part of <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em> that the game features both a Stage Replay and an Arcade mode. These extra features allow you to repeat key sections of the game, the former to chase missed items or simply grind for experience and ability points (used to upgrade Clive\'s skills), the latter to earn ranked performance scores. While entirely optional, their inclusion emphasises how far this instalment moves the series into the realms of action, challenging players to pursue stylish combos and flawless performance above mere victory.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>What, then, of that essence, that feel of <em>Final Fantasy</em>? That\'s found in just about everything outside of battle. It\'s found in the spaces it creates, with locations evocative of past entries but brought up to a near photo-real standard, and in characters with distinctive  if often outlandish  designs. It\'s in mechanical touches that harken back to the franchise\'s history, such as the return of a world map (although, in another nod to <em>Game Of Thrones</em>, its topography looks awfully familiar to the show\'s opening credits). It\'s in a sprawling story exploring deeper themes, and in side quests that expound upon the world and characters who inhabit it. It\'s in the visual language of the game, from callbacks such as a shadowy figure in a burning village evoking key moments in <em>FF VII</em>, to the presence of simple series stalwarts such as crystals and moogles. There are even a few modifiers for combat that enable players to drag it slightly closer to those traditional RPG roots, with equippable items such as the Ring Of Timely Evasion allowing the less action-proficient the briefest of windows to react and respond to attacks. It\'s not exactly the return of turn-based combat, but it is an olive branch to long-time fans.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Some of those most ardent fans may still be put off by just how much <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em> departs from its precursors, be it in the wholesale changes to combat and the loss of any real party to manage, or its desperate-to-be-edgy potty mouth and sometimes shocking levels of grisly violence. Yet most of the risks <em>FF XVI</em> takes pay off, helping to evolve and redefine what a core <em>Final Fantasy</em> can be. Most importantly, this is a world and story you\'ll want to get lost in, ultimately delivering far more emotional heft by the time the credits roll than the series has seen in years.</p>\n</span>', '2024-03-13 05:00:01', '2024-03-13 05:00:01', 'Final Fantasy XVI Review', 'https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/ff16-1.jpg?ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=top&auto=format&w=1440&q=80', 'movies', 'https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-xvi/', 'Platform: PS5 Square Enix really wants you to know that Final Fantasy...', 'gaming');

Where previous titles in the genre had tied missions together with barely coherent narratives, Relic\'s space opera told a heart-rending story of galactic refugees fleeing persecution to find their ancestral home. From the initial genocide that sees the death of millions to the final conflict with the Taidan empire, <em>Homeworld</em> made you a part of its tale. Enormous space battles threw fighters, frigates, and destroyers together in spectacular fashion, while the sparse, endless beauty of space was perfectly captured by the striking visuals and Paul Ruskay\'s haunting score. Remastered in 2015, its stellar landscapes are even more beautiful to behold, leaving no excuse for newcomers not to seek it out.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<h1 id=\"h-99-forza-horizon-5\"><strong>99.

No-one had a clue just how odd, though  <em>Splatoons</em> neon-soaked world of style-obsessed squid-human hybrids remains a contender for the developers strangest property ever. Yet, in Nintendos inimitable style, it was also an absolute joy to play: battles where victory was determined by the most ink sloshed around the map, and where a smart shapeshifting mechanic allowed you to dive into that ink in squid form for speed boosts or stealth attacks. The ability to swim vertically on walls daubed in your teams ink made for clever approaches to area control and attack vectors too. While its sequels have refined the formula, the sheer genius of the original Wii U version cant be ignored.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<h1><strong>97.

With an exciting roster of characters old and new  plus guests including <em>The Witchers</em> Geralt of Rivia  and a surprisingly deep story, the Stage of History has never had a better performance.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<h1><strong>96.

A game that is still regarded as the high point for the entire franchise, and one that convinced Nintendo to stick with it.

They neednt have worried. While <em>World</em> was definitely more accessible to newcomers, with a deeper story focused on colonies mapping out a dangerous new continent in its low-fantasy world and more accessible onboarding, it was every bit as challenging and rewarding as its predecessors. The signature gameplay loop of tracking down vicious monsters, then repurposing their innards for weapons and armour to take down even tougher ones, was as addictive as ever, but bolstered by a streamlined skill system, meals that provide stat buffs, and a gorgeous open world. If all that isnt enough to win you over, maybe the fact that you have kitty assistants throughout will.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<h1><strong>92.

Taking jabs at complaints over the first games violence, it introduced comedic Babalities and Friendship finishing moves  to complement even more violent Fatalities, of course. It also improved on the original as a fighting game, with a more elaborate moveset. Punches and kicks landed differently according to crouched or upright positioning, characters enjoyed power balances, combo flows were impacted by tweaked recovery times, and there was an expanded roster of fighters to put those moves into practice with.

Writer and designer Ragnar Trnquist served up a tale spanning twin worlds of science and mysticism, one that touched on themes of destiny and determinism while subverting tropes of sci-fi and fantasy at every turn. Arguably the last great point-and-click adventure, <em>The Longest Journey</em> backed up its complex narrative with high production values, ingenious puzzles  although, mention the rubber ducky one to a fan and watch their forehead vein throb as the rage throwbacks kick in  and some of the best voice acting heard in a game, resulting in <em>two</em> worlds you couldnt bear to leave by the time the credits rolled.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<h1><strong>87.

Critics swooned, but almost no-one bought a copy, sounding the death knell of the story-driven puzzle genre and spawning a group of die-hard superfans worshipping the game\'s dark humour, bonkers but brilliant storyline and harder-than-a-cryptic-crossword riddles. Nowhere else would a gun that fires marigolds be so frightening.

Yet its impossible not to be blown away by whats on offer here: a chance to wade directly into the battle against the Combine. Stepping into the shoes of fan-favourite character Alyx Vance, players with the real world space can literally wander the world in room scale VR. Meanwhile, Alyxs Gravity Gloves offer an upgrade on Gordon Freemans Gravity Gun from <em>Half-Life 2</em>, and the immersion allows the game to really play up the horror factor. Yes, the barrier to entry is high  <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> is really designed for Valves uber-pricey Index headset, and youll need a powerful graphics card to get the best out of the game  but all told, its VRs first true killer app.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<h1><strong>85.

Yet its the most recent entry that nabs it  a visually gorgeous outing that, despite being a cross-generational release, feels like the first of the genre to make use of the power of PS5 and Xbox Series X. Its not just the visual spectacle, though  the complex themes of colonisation and oppression are some of the deepest the series has ever attempted, centred on the technologically advanced Renans and the Dahnan people oppressed by them. Dual protagonists Alphen, a Dahnan slave, and Shionne, a Renan noble on the run, form the core of a fantastic cast of playable characters, while <em>Arise</em> delivers the finest version of the series speedy Linear Motion Battle System yet seen.

There was a 12-year gap between the second and third core games, which makes the 11-year wait since 2012s <em>Diablo III</em> seem positively brisk. But when the only other new title to join Blizzards action RPG franchise in that time was the controversial <em>Diablo Immortal</em> - a mobile-first instalment that was heavy on microtransactions - those same patient fans were not unjustly cautious that <em>Diablo IV</em> may suffer the same fate.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Fear not - while paid battle passes are planned for later in the games life-cycle, for launch at least <em>Diablo IVs</em> microtransactions are entirely cosmetic and optional. On the plus side, that means that nothing in terms of gameplay-relevant content is locked behind a paywall. On the negative, those cosmetics are horrendously expensive - were talking the equivalent of 13 for horse armour, or a Triune Apostate armour set for your playable character that will set you back 21. Youre going to have to seriously love this game and have pretty deep pockets to ever wander across to the in-game shop tab.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Thankfully, there is a lot to love elsewhere. <em>Diablo IV</em> almost feels stripped back to the series central strengths. The emphasis is on strong real-time action, fun character classes boasting interesting abilities to experiment with, and brilliantly designed dungeons to navigate, all set in a world that feels more consistent and connected than the somewhat fragmented geography of its predecessor. It also enjoys a campaign storyline that balances threat and gravitas - demon queen Lilith, the Daughter of Hatred, has been unleashed on the world of Sanctuary, where she sets about warring with the angel Inarius - with a more grounded approach, rooting your character in the muddy, messy lives of the mortals caught up in the battle, with less of the politicking and dalliances with nobles and rulers of previous entries.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"Diablo IV\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/D4-Launch_Media-Thumbs_Strongholds_1600.jpeg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/D4-Launch_Media-Thumbs_Strongholds_1600.jpeg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/D4-Launch_Media-Thumbs_Strongholds_1600.jpeg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/D4-Launch_Media-Thumbs_Strongholds_1600.jpeg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/D4-Launch_Media-Thumbs_Strongholds_1600.jpeg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/D4-Launch_Media-Thumbs_Strongholds_1600.jpeg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/D4-Launch_Media-Thumbs_Strongholds_1600.jpeg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>The result is a lot of really great emergent storytelling. While the core plot sees you chasing Lilith across Sanctuary, side quests that dont immediately appear to link or connect paint a more detailed picture of the lives of the people you meet along the way. A villager who asks you to seek out his missing mother offers deeper insight into the world and its history if returned to with particular trinkets in hand, while revisiting the first village you encounter - where you were drugged by its inhabitants and fed demon blood, drawing you into the hunt for Lilith in the first place - may lead to encounters with characters researching the horrors that befell the fallen community. This is a world that you cant help but feel immersed in.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Blizzard hasnt rocked the boat when it comes to the series gameplay though, with <em>Diablo IV</em> generally refining rather than revamping. Character classes offer a best of roster from the series history, with Sorcerer, Barbarian, Rogue, Necromancer, and Druid making their return here, some having not been seen for decades. Theres a solid character creator to customise your player avatar to your liking, albeit with some odd restrictions, such as bigger bodies being the domain of Barbarians and Druids only.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Every class has their pros and cons, but whichever you choose youll be wandering Sanctuary slaying the forces of hell - and the occasional bandit or cultist - at every turn. Early on, combat does feel repetitive, tapping out an RSI-inducing staccato of basic attacks, but as you power up, attacks that have cooldowns between uses or, depending on class, drain pools of spirit or fury to cast add a bit more consideration to holding back the hordes. Hordes is the key word, too - <em>Diablo IV</em> excels at spectacle, with some major encounters having countless enemies on screen at once, all attacking in a frenzied hum.</p>\n</span><div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__ynq1g\" data-test=\"pullquote\">\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__icon__JGpkh\"><span></span></div>\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__content__gRuai\">\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is a world you can\'t help but feel immersed in.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>And, just as <em>Diablo IV</em> delivers some great moments of emergent storytelling, so too does it offer up moments of brilliant emergent gameplay. Explore Sanctuary and youll inevitably come across spontaneous events where youll have a limited window to meet an objective, giving a real sense of a living world rather than one that exists only to service your adventure.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Of course, <em>Diablo</em> as a series has always been more about the metagame than the initial hack-and-slash presentation of the base experience, and <em>Diablo IV</em> is no exception. Its not <em>really</em> about liberating Sanctuary from Lilith  its about your character builds, your load-outs, your precious loot and how the shiniest drop from one battle soon becomes junk when something even shinier drops from the next. Its about everything that comes after the credits roll at the end of the campaign, and how meticulously you can craft your hero for the greater challenges that await. Higher World Tier difficulty levels, seeking out Nightmare Sigils that modify existing catacombs into frenzied Nightmare Dungeons, and ferocious World Bosses that require a host of players to take down are amongst the ongong dark delights of the endgame.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Its a shame that the character abilities screen doesnt better serve this focus, though. Up to level 50, each level gained earns you a skill point to spend, while further points can be gained by completing certain quests or earning renown in a region. These are then spent to unlock skills along a descending grid, progress along it represented as a suspiciously blood-like fluid flowing down the channels of the ability map. Think of a more linear version of <em>Final Fantasy Xs</em> sphere grid and youre in the ballpark.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Unfortunately, theres no way to zoom out and see your whole build and where youve assigned points in one view, which makes planning those builds tricky. Although Blizzard has tried to mitigate this by having each central node represent a particular group of skills  basic attacks, defensive abilities, ultimates, and so on  when some power-ups can buff others on different nodes, it becomes fiddly to hop between them to make sure youve put points into the corresponding ability. For instance, on our Druid (lightning strikes and werebear transformations? Yes, please!), a talent called Endless Tempest increases the duration of the elemental attacks Hurricane and Cataclysm, each of which are found on two different nodes with no clear link between them.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Things only get more complicated after a character hits level 50 and unlocks Paragon abilities, an entirely different board of skills to tackle, many essentially improving on the groundwork youll have laid from levels 1-49. Overall, it all feels too busy and granular to navigate, to the point that even veteran <em>Diablo</em> players may find the whole character build system unintuitive.

Warp to 2023 though, and developer Dramatic Labs  formed by former Telltale CEO Kevin Bruner and with plenty of staff moving over with him  is correcting that mistake with <em>Resurgence</em>. Thankfully, there\'s no wait between chapters though, as this is a complete branching tale delivered in one go.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Set after <em>Star Trek: Nemesis</em>, <em>Resurgence</em> puts you in the shoes of First Officer Jara Rydek, a Starfleet Academy ace who graduated top of her class, and Carter Diaz, an engineering whiz. Both are aboard the USS Resolute, a recently repaired science vessel under the command of Captain Solano, with Jara struggling to win over her new crewmates, and Diaz juggling an understaffed engineering department and perhaps a few too many problems to solve before the ship is space-ready again.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>For <em>Trek</em> fans, it\'s all immediately recognisable territory, with a crew of likeable if disparate personalities to get to know, and relationships to form with them as both playable characters. The core mission is a diplomatic one, engaging in peace talks between the Alydians and the Hotari, two races at odds over access to a dilithium mine. With foresight, the disagreement and its potentially fractious outcomes may feel slightly poignant, given what we know happens to dilithium by the time of <em>Discovery</em> season three, but it\'s a strong starting point before affairs spiral out into conspiracy and deeper interplanetary politics.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/startrek-char-spock1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/startrek-char-spock1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/startrek-char-spock1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/startrek-char-spock1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/startrek-char-spock1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/startrek-char-spock1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/startrek-char-spock1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>You alternate control between the two leads, giving a greater insight into the operations of the Resolute. It\'s not just switching between issuing commands as Jara and fixing warp coils as Carter though  decisions made by one can impact the other, even when not directly interacting. Across the game, you\'ll uncover a host of personal and professional problems, for the leads as well as their crewmates. Key decisions will impact how others view you  if Carter is too flippant with his overly logical Vulcan department head, for instance, it\'ll be remembered and influence later conversations. You\'ll only have a short window to choose a response for any decision, which both keeps dialogue breezy and prevents players ruminating too much on the potential outcomes.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>In an interesting diversion for the narrative adventure genre, there\'s no morality system in <em>Resurgence</em>. Choices may be politically loaded or impact the lives of the rest of the crew, if not entire cultures, but its not divided into a dichotomy of mawkish good or cackling evil. If anything, the game trusts in the inherent morality of the <em>Trek</em> universe, of Roddenberry\'s goal of \"infinite diversity in infinite combinations\", of treating others with compassion as a first response. Whether you actually follow those tenets in the game or not is up to you, of course.</p>\n</span><div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__ynq1g\" data-test=\"pullquote\">\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__icon__JGpkh\"><span></span></div>\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__content__gRuai\">\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Even in its more active sequences, Resurgence keeps you thinking.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>It\'s not all talk, talk, talk, though. There are plenty of puzzles to solve, often using tricorder functions, which add some satisfying brain teasers beyond moral quandaries and relationship management. These are let down slightly by the tricorder beeping when in proximity of <em>anything</em> that can be scanned, whether you\'ve already done so or not, which can be both distracting and misleading. <em>Resurgence</em> also makes use of the <em>Star Trek</em> licence to the fullest, with the occasional shuttle to pilot or more action-packed phaser shoot-out, but even these are often in service to the choice-based gameplay. Do you set phasers to stun or kill? What are the repercussions of that? How does it influence what comes next? Even in its more active sequences, <em>Resurgence</em> keeps you thinking.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>It all looks rather marvellous, too. The Resolute itself is all <em>Next Generation</em>-era sleek lines and minimalist interiors, while the sheer majesty of nebulae and alien worlds is often jaw-droppingly beautiful. Character models are impressively detailed, and not just for major characters  fan-favourite alien races pepper backgrounds, instantly recognisable from the various shows. Walking animation is a bit ropey at times, mainly due to some inconsistency over where you can run or not  professional decorum sometimes locks you into a painfully slow stroll through ship corridors, which can look and feel incredibly stilted  but overall, it\'s all lovely to look at. Even the system UI echoes the LCARS display panels seen on <em>TNG, DS9,</em> and <em>Voyager</em>.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Between the previous output of Telltale Games and its peers, including the likes of <em>Life is Strange</em>, you\'ll probably have an idea by now if these sorts of interactive narrative adventures are your cup of Earl Grey.

It was a terrible year for many reasons, but one of its oft-forgotten sins is the state that<em>Street Fighter V</em>launched in. It suffered server woes that blighted online play, lacked an arcade mode  surely the barest of bones in a fighting game!  and, barring a competent tutorial explaining the intricacies of its systems, had a single player offering that wasnt l much to write home about either. While Capcom spent the months and years afterwards fixing and tweaking the game, eventually bringing it up to tournament standard, its easy to understand why some worried<em>Street Fighter 6</em>might suffer a similar fate. Fear not, though  the latest bout in the globe-trotting fighting series is a delight from the first punch thrown.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>In many ways, it builds on the strengths of its predecessors, with a satisfying flow to battles and a host of gorgeous arenas to fight in. Although everything is rendered in 3D, as has been the case since<em>Street Fighter IV</em>, rounds continue to take place on a 2D plane, allowing for all the back-and-forth gameplay fans expect, vying for area control or trapping your opponent in a corner to hammer them with combos. If you haven\'t played<em>Street Fighter</em>in years, you can still jump in and feel immediately at home. Plus, with eighteen characters at launch  six of them brand new to the series  theres no shortage of fighters to get to grips with.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"Street Fighter 6\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/street-fighter-6.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/street-fighter-6.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/street-fighter-6.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/street-fighter-6.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/street-fighter-6.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/street-fighter-6.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/street-fighter-6.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>The big shift is the new Drive System, the latest in<em>Street Fighter\'s</em>line of combat-modifying power gauges. You\'ll be able to \'spend\' chunks of this for a variety of effects  Drive Reversals, similar to<em>SF5\'s</em>V-Reversals, can break off an enemy\'s attack, ruining their combos and giving you a bit of breathing room. Drive Rush lets you burst forwards, linking attacks and combos that might not otherwise combine. Best of all is Drive Impact, which shatters through up to three incoming attacks to deliver an even more powerful one of your own, potentially turning the tables in a tough match. The only real counter to a Drive Impact is one of your own, which makes<em>SF6</em>surprisingly psychological as you try to read opponents\' moves or tempt them into using a Drive Impact on you in order to counter with yours. Overall, it\'s one of the best systems Capcom has ever introduced in the series, and along with splashes of vibrant colour, one of the flashiest, too.</p>\n</span><div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__ynq1g\" data-test=\"pullquote\">\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__icon__JGpkh\"><span></span></div>\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__content__gRuai\">\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One of the best aspects of the game though is away from the actual versus mode fighting, with the single-player World Tour.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Other improvements include those aforementioned control intricacies, which are ameliorated thanks to multiple input methods. For purists, there\'s the traditional<em>Street Fighter</em>six-button approach, with heavy-medium-light kicks and punches allowing for all the precision and complexity fans have come to expect. Yet that complexity has itself been accused of scaring off newcomers, so Capcom has introduced the \'Modern\' layout. This is arguably better suited to controller play, with special moves assigned to a single button paired with a directional input, with throws, assists, Drive Impacts and Drive Parries mapped to shoulder buttons. For returning players, this stripped back approach feels quite strange, especially if you\'ve spent years memorising combos for favourite characters, but it\'s going to do wonders for making the game more accessible.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Capcom also, wisely, isn\'t segregating players using each play style  there\'s a marker onscreen indicating which control scheme rivals are using, but the rest comes down to mastering<em>SF6\'s</em>systems. It\'s<em>Street Fighter</em>with added egalitarianism, making ranked competitive play viable for those without an arcade stick peripheral. A third control method, the incredibly stripped back \'Dynamic\' mode,<em>is</em>restricted though, but since this includes an AI driven auto-battle feature aimed at bringing total beginners into the game, that\'s to be expected.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"Street Fighter 6\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/street-fighter-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/street-fighter-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/street-fghter-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/street-fighter-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/street-fighter-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/street-fighter-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/street-fighter-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>One of the best aspects of the game though is away from the actual versus mode fighting, with the single-player World Tour. This story-driven side of the game sees you building an avatar from one of the most spectacularly detailed character creators we\'ve seen, then guiding them through a 25 to 30-hour action-adventure/RPG hybrid. Almost anyone you cross paths with is up for a scrap  at which point World Tour switches from its 3D exploration mode to<em>Street Fighter\'s</em>traditional 2D battle plane  with experience earned from each victory.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>The main thrust of the story is your character travelling around the<em>Street Fighter</em>world, learning from masters (the more iconic characters) to \"learn the true meaning of strength\". That means starting off in a gym run by<em>SF5\'s</em>Luke, where training involves wandering Metro City <em>SF</em>and<em>Final Fight\'s</em>proxy for New York  and buying stat-boosting accessories from fashion stores, or battling gang members who roam the streets wearing cardboard boxes. It means doing kung-fu with Chun-Li in Chinatown, or travelling to India to study under Dhalsim. Each master you win over unlocks their unique fighting style for you to use, but more importantly, means you can rank up your friendship with them and take selfies. It\'s all brilliantly bonkers in the best way, and while World Tour may not be the big draw for the more competitive side of<em>Street Fighter</em>fandom, it\'s an absolute joy for the less ardent.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>You\'ll also be able to take your custom character into<em>SF6\'s</em>last big mode, the online focused Battle Hub. While you can bypass it and jump straight into a brawl through the system menus, the Battle Hub presents a sort of virtual arcade to explore  complete with retro Capcom games to play  and interact with other players. It\'s here where you\'ll want to show off your most imaginative character build, pick up new cosmetics, and even be able to sit down at actual arcade cabinets to launch into a versus match. It\'s an incredibly fun addition, and really speaks to the social and community aspect of the fighting genre fandom.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>There are some concerns with<em>Street Fighter 6</em>. Like its most recent precursor, it\'s envisaged as a live service game, with both DLC characters to be drip-fed into the game and, of more concern, a premium in-game currency, although Capcom says micro-transactions won\'t amount to pay-to-win. However,<em>as</em>a live service game, any problems that emerge can be tweaked and corrected over the months and years to come, and this has the benefit of launching in a much stronger starting state than<em>Street Fighter V</em>did. If Capcom has been searching for the true meaning of strength since that game, they\'ve found it in<em>Street Fighter 6</em>.</p>\n</span>', '2024-03-13 05:00:01', '2024-03-13 05:00:01', 'Street Fighter 6 Review', 'https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/06/street-fighter-2.jpg?ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=top&auto=format&w=1440&q=80', 'movies', 'https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/street-fighter-6/', 'Platforms:PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC Cast your mind back to...', 'gaming'),

It\'s a stealth game with despairingly few stealth sections, and where the mechanics to enable it  hide in shadows, throw rocks to distract guards, occasionally choke an orc from behind  are insultingly basic. Gollum himself moves like the worst Spider-sona you can possibly imagine<em><a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-trailer-dazzling-action-deep-emotion/\" target=\"_blank\">Across The Spider-Verse</a></em>introducing, an overly springy bundle of withered Hobbit flesh who can simultaneously leap over vast chasms and clamber up (very specifically marked) walls, but can\'t out-run an orc guard. Worse still, those meagre stealth mechanics aren\'t even well implemented: guards won\'t necessarily go where you fling a pebble, or they\'ll detect Gollum even when out of view. Worst of all, controls will randomly stop working  jumping or crouching cut out frequently, meaning the frequent deaths and detections at the hands of Sauron\'s minions. Checkpointing is, at least, mercifully frequent, as you\'ll be repeating sections often.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"Gollum\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/05/gollum-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/05/gollum-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/05/gollum-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/05/gollum-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/05/gollum-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/05/gollum-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/05/gollum-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Well, maybe not that often, since<em>Gollum</em>also throws cutscene after cutscene after mandatory dialogue sequence at you, to the extent that it feels as though gameplay is some sort of unwanted interruption. Ironic, then, that the all-important story that we can\'t possibly be torn away from by silly considerations like \"playing the game\" is impenetrable. Sure, this is meant to be set between<em><a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/hobbit-unexpected-journey-review/\" target=\"_blank\">The Hobbit</a></em>and<em><a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/lord-rings-fellowship-ring-review/\" target=\"_blank\">The Fellowship Of The Ring</a></em>, detailing Gollum\'s activitiesin that period, but you\'d be hard pressed to pull out anything memorable as nothing makes sense. You\'ll jump from one activity to another with scarcely any connective tissue explaining why you\'re doing it; a section in a prison forces you through repetitive, rote tasks  more minigames than anything  before arbitrarily jumping the plot forward.

Gone are the rune abilities of yore (magnetism, ice blocks, time stop and bombs), replaced with four completely different, game-altering powers. One allows you to attach objects to your weapons  ostensibly a mechanic to increase damage, but one that comes into its own with a little experimentation. Yes, you can stick a boulder to a sword to make a hammer, or a spiked ball to a spear for added heft, but things become interesting once you get creative with the games new Zonai tech. These artefacts of an advanced yet long extinct race (whose abandoned technology also adds new architecture and formidable mechanical enemies) provide endless gadgets for Link to use and abuse in the pursuit of absolute chaos. Stick a fire emitter on the end of a spear and you have a flamethrower. Put a spring on your shield and anyone who strikes it will be catapulted away. Swap the spring for a rocket and you have a jetpack. In essence, as long as something isnt walking around or bolted to the floor, theres a good chance you can turn it into an offensive weapon.</p>\n</span><div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__ynq1g\" data-test=\"pullquote\">\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__icon__JGpkh\"><span></span></div>\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__content__gRuai\">\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Theres an intoxicating sense of possibility to every moment of gameplay.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Continuing this adhesive theme, a second power brings the art of stickiness to the wider environment,allowing you to glue almost any two objects together to almost game-breaking effect. Thwarted by a gaping chasm? Thats nothing an axe and a passion for deforestation cant overcome. Chop down a dozen trees, glue them end-to-end and voila: you have a bridge.A few logs and a sail will give you a boat. A few more and a fan will make a speed boat. Add four wheels to a wooden board and you have yourself a car. You get the idea. Theres an intoxicating sense of possibility to every moment of gameplay; a notion that you could access any place, overcome any obstacle, just by sticking one object to another and seeing what happens. Need to lift something up a hill? Attach a balloon and light a fire underneath. Want to create Hyrules first monorail? A box and a large metal hook will set you on the path.

After inadvertently awakening the mummified corpse of The Demon King, Zelda is flung into a fissure, the Master Sword is shattered, and Link awakes to find himself stripped of clothes, hairband (cue a newly shaggy mane) and, crucially, his right arm, which is swiftly replaced with one from a Zonai corpse, turning him into a kind of necrotic Winter Soldier. The setup isnt a million miles away from that of the first game, and will have you once more journey to the lands of the rock-loving Goron, the avian Ritu, the aquatic Zora and the desert-dwelling Gerudo, this time to deal with various gloom-inflicted disasters, recruiting familiar faces for the final battle along the way. There are a few twists and turns, and Zeldas part in the story is thankfully more nuanced than having just been kidnapped yet again, but in story structure at least,<em>Tears Of The Kingdom</em> does bear faint traces of the DLC idea it started life as.</p>\n</span><div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__ynq1g\" data-test=\"pullquote\">\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__icon__JGpkh\"><span></span></div>\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__content__gRuai\">\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A living, breathing environment coupled with a euphoric, unparalleled sense of freedom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>None of that really matters with a world this inviting, however. As before, Hyrules sprawling landscape is a playground without peer. But just as the game mechanics have been overhauled, so too has the topography. The Demon Kings emergence has sundered the landscape, leaving chasms in the earth and other adverse conditions that make the first games rolling hills and verdant meadows far more perilous. The map, while at first glance covering the same land mass as before, has been expanded substantially. Starting with a new tutorial zone, Hyrule has been granted a dizzying verticality, with Zonai sky islands floating amongst the clouds like the Hallelujah Mountains of Avatar. That these provide a new venue for vertiginous platforming is true enough but they come into their own when employed as staging areas from which to base jump over Hyrule proper, skydiving over mountain and desert before whipping out the trusty Paraglider for a precision landing. Clearly inspired by the airways of<em><a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/legend-zelda-skyward-sword-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Skyward Sword</a></em>, this latest Zelda embraces the Y-Axis wholeheartedly, providing numerous inventive methods for Link to grab big air, from rockets and trampolines to balloons and even gust-inducing pine cones.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/05/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/05/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/05/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/05/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/05/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/05/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/05/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>As above, so below: complementing access to the sky is a chance to plumb the depths, taking the action deep beneath the earth from whence the gloom originates. These spelunking trips into near total blackness arent quite as giddy as gliding through the heavens but provide another new dimension as you scrabble desperately for light-sources and take on minions of the dark. Spanning depths, surface and sky, the three-tiered map reinvigorates a landscape we once knew so well, granting an almost overwhelming scope to the play area this time around and ensuring it will be months, not weeks, before you want to emerge. There are Koroks to find, houses to build and furnish, myriad gastronomical delights to concoct, geoglyphs to explore, shrines to complete, and even signs to erect in an on-going side-quest that will appeal to budding semiologists. All of which is just as appealing, if not more so, then unravelling the mystery of Zeldas fate. The storytelling here might not be on a par with something like<em><a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/last-us-review/\" target=\"_blank\">The Last Of Us</a></em>, but the real joy, once again, is in telling your own tale, in setting out for a distant shrine but getting side-tracked by a hidden cave, an ancient ruin, a merchant in distress or a mountainside of fresh powder simply begging to be shield-surfed.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>If theres any criticism to be made of<em>Tears Of The Kingdom</em>, its possibly that so much of<em>Breath Of The Wild</em> carries over: from the aesthetic, to key locations and many of the returning characters. The combat is sometimes fiddly, difficulty spikes feel occasionally mis-judged and some of the harder puzzles are positively obtuse, but everything that made up<em>Breath Of The Wild</em>persists here for a reason. We could say that Nintendo havent re-invented the wheel, but they have: in allowing you to stick four on a tree trunk and construct a rudimentary luge. In carrying forward what worked so flawlessly and building out new, transformative mechanics,<em>Tears Of The Kingdom</em>feels like the game<em>Breath Of The Wild</em>always wanted to be: a living, breathing environment coupled with a euphoric, unparalleled sense of freedom.<em>Breath Of The Wild</em>was an instant classic but with this precisely-calibrated, audaciously-conceived sequel, Nintendo has accomplished the improbable and demonstrated tht you really can improve upon perfection.</p>\n</span>', '2024-03-13 05:00:01', '2024-03-13 05:00:01', 'The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom Review', 'https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/05/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-main.jpg?ar=16%3A9&ft=crop&crop=top&auto=format&w=1440&q=80', 'movies', 'https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/', 'Platforms:Nintendo Switch When Link, fresh from a century-long slumber,...', 'gaming'),

The simple act of getting returning, crimson-haired protagonist Cal Kestis from point A to B is an absolute joy, and that\'s before you consider the optional, potential rewards you might discover upon reaching his destinations.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>These plentiful side activities never feel like busy work or fetch quests either, but meaningful detours that help progress your character, complement the story, or maybe even put you face to face with a bounty hunter that\'s been tracking you. New Force powers, like the ability to tame and mount beasts, adds yet another layer, allowing you to reach previously inaccessible areas for even more goodies.</p>\n</span><div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__ynq1g\" data-test=\"pullquote\">\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__icon__JGpkh\"><span></span></div>\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__content__gRuai\">\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One of the best single-player, story-driven Star Wars experiences to grace any console or PC.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Of course, this thoughtful design shines brightest during combat encounters, where Cal  now a card-carrying Jedi Knight  builds on his previous expertise with new stances and Force-fueled skills. The former, especially, have been significantly expanded, offering players five dedicated combat stances. Whether you want to slice-and-dice with a lightsaber in each hand or show Darth Maul how it\'s done from behind a double-bladed laser staff, there\'s no shortage of ways to carve your way through the galaxy.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Deliberate, methodical, and brutally lethal, the Kylo Ren-inspired Crossguard stance is our new Stormtrooper-crushing favorite. And while wielding a gun saps some of the melee-focused strategy from encounters, it\'s hard to deny the intoxicating feel that comes with simultaneously firing a pistol and swinging a lightsaber from behind the new Blaster stance. Further personalization comes courtesy of character-progressing skill trees and a steady accrual of perks.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>If <em>Survivor</em> stumbles at all, it\'s in the cadence of its storytelling. Make no mistake, the game spins an absorbing yarn, one that\'s more emotional and personal than its predecessor\'s tale.

This is largely a product of those aforementioned optional activities which, while entertaining, rewarding, and often complementary to the larger narrative, can also pull you from the critical path. Mileage will vary, but don\'t be surprised if you lose track of key plot threads while sinking hours into the gardening simulation mini-game  yep, that\'s a thing.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>That nitpick aside, <em>Survivor</em> isn\'t just a stronger game than the original, but an enthralling action-adventure, an early game-of-the-year contender, and one of the best single-player, story-driven <em>Star Wars</em> experiences to grace any console or PC.</p>\n</span>', '2024-03-13 05:00:01', '2024-03-13 05:00:01', 'Star Wars: Jedi Survivor Review', 'https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/04/STAR-WARS-Jedi_-Survivor%E2%84%A2_20230418172747-1.jpeg?ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=top&auto=format&w=1440&q=80', 'movies', 'https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/star-wars-jedi-survivor/', 'Platforms: PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC Given just a passing glance, Star Wars...', 'gaming'),

Announced in 2021, the project upgrades the first six core games in the role-playing franchise in a manner that aims to preserve the tone and overall aesthetic of the original 8-bit and 16-bit games, while making them a bit more palatable to contemporary players and adding a bit of future-proofing for audiences down the line.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>The six games, stretching from 1987\'s original<em>Final Fantasy</em>to 1994\'s<em>Final Fantasy VI</em>, were initially drip-fed to PC players over the course of the last two years. However, those releases were met with responses ranging from icy to enthusiastic, with complaints ranging from changes going too far to the fonts not looking right.</p>\n</span><div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__ynq1g\" data-test=\"pullquote\">\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__icon__JGpkh\"><span></span></div>\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__content__gRuai\">\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is a real goldmine of classic JRPG entertainment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>That last one was fair cop, and one of the best improvements Square Enix has made to the<em>Pixel Remasters</em>on PS4 and Switch (version tested). While the smooth, modern fonts remain the default across all six games  and yes, they do look jarringly out of place in these pixellated worlds  a quick switch to \'Classic\' in the configuration menu of each title restores a much more aesthetically pleasing pixel font that\'s still sharp and easy to read.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>The benefit of other changes to these classics will depend on just how much of a purist you are. It\'s undeniable that the first three games, which saw release on the humble NES, get the biggest overhaul. For example, the black battle screens of the OGs are done away with, replaced with slightly more detailed pixel art settings that make the encounters just a bit more interesting to look at, without any material change to the classic turn-based combat.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/04/ff-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/04/ff-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/04/ff-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/04/ff-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/04/ff-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/04/ff-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/04/ff-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Yet even that earliest entry doesn\'t try to rewrite history too much  interiors of buildings still float in nebulous voids, layouts of villages and dungeons remain unchanged  albeit with some pixel-based beautification  and the overworld map remains essentially the same, just a bit sharper. Is it a 100% recreation of the 1987<em>Final Fantasy</em>? No. Does it capture the feel without becoming a different game entirely? Yes. It\'s still the simple tale of four nameless Warriors of Light restoring the world that kicked off the franchise all those years ago, it\'s just visually tolerable on a 4K TV now. In fact, for returning players, the best part of the<em>Pixel Remaster</em>project as a whole may be how the visual approach presents each game as how you<em>think</em>you remember the looking  memory is a funny thing.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Other titles have their own curiosities, though. For instance,<em>Final Fantasy III</em>is a particularly odd one, having previously enjoyed a 3D remake on the Nintendo DS. The version here is rebuilt from the 1990 NES original, which makes it both remake and downgrade.<em>Final Fantasy VI</em>, originally released on the SNES in 1994, remains a contender for one of the best entries in the entire series, but lacks the flashy CG cinematics that were added to its 1999 rerelease on PS1. It\'s a common theme across the<em>Pixel Remasters</em> these aren\'t definitive editions of the titles because there\'s essentially no such thing.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/04/ff-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/04/ff-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/04/ff-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/04/ff-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/04/ff-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/04/ff-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/04/ff-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Across the board, Square Enix has added a host of quality of life improvements to the games. Beyond the visual revamp bringing these pixel beauties up to a 16:9 aspect ratio, fully instrumental music now accompanies each game (and is easily swapped for the original chiptune versions of the soundtracks, if you prefer), while mini-maps now float in the corner of the screen, helping navigate some of the labyrinthine dungeons the series is known for. There are also features to streamline level grinding and exploration, from boosts to experience points and money earned after each battle, to the option to turn random encounters off with a press of the right thumbstick. Admittedly, some of these tools arguably go too far  the ability to set random fights to auto-battle has the games essentially playing themselves  but the beauty of these tools is that they\'re all optional. If you still want an experience as close to 1987 as possible, you can create that by turning all the updates off.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>One aspect that does slightly disappoint is that this collection isn\'t really, well, a collection. Unlike other anniversary re-releases of classic games, remastered or not  think the various<em>Mega Man Legacy Collection</em>packages, or<em>Sonic Origins</em> there\'s no framing package housing all six games. Buy the bundle on either the Nintendo or PlayStation digital storefronts and you\'ll simply get all six games as their own downloads. While it does mean players have the option to buy only the games they want or stretch the cost of buying all six (<em>I</em>and<em>II</em>sell for 9.49 each,<em>III-VI</em>are 14.99 each, or its 64.99 for the bundle), it does feel a bit of a missed opportunity to not cram in some library content or digital extras to celebrate these key entries for the series.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Still, there\'s no denying that whether you pick them up individually or as a collection, this is a real goldmine of classic JRPG entertainment. The earliest instalments, with their comparatively straightforward stories and simplistic battle systems may be entering \'historic curiosity\' territory, but still hold a certain charm and hold up to playing in 2023, while later ones  notably<em>IV</em>and<em>VI</em> remain all-time greats. With the tweaks and improvements from the PC releases that Square Enix has implemented, these should stand the test of time for at least another decade.</p>\n</span>', '2024-03-13 05:00:01', '2024-03-13 05:00:01', 'Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster Collection Review', 'https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/04/ff-4.jpg?ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=top&auto=format&w=1440&q=80', 'movies', 'https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-pixel-remaster-collection/', 'Platforms:Nintendo Switch, PS4 As the medium of video games evolves and...', 'gaming'),

That\'s not to say there\'s nothing new in <em>Burning Shores</em>; Aloy gets a handful of fresh abilities to add to her progression tree (not least a handy grapple strike that allows you to close in on enemies with a satisfying downward slam), and the new region  roughly a third of the size of the main map  has its own ecosystem of unique machines, including the aforementioned Waterwing alongside the horrifyingly toad-like Bilegut. That said, these additions are simply embellishments to the existing template established by <em>Forbidden West</em>\'s original campaign, rather than any drastic subversions to that mold.</p>\n</span><div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__ynq1g\" data-test=\"pullquote\">\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__icon__JGpkh\"><span></span></div>\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__content__gRuai\">\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The spectacle is well worth the cost of admission.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p><em>Burning Shore</em>\'s story does, at least, feel like an important chapter for <em>Horizon</em>\'s ongoing saga, not just in the way that it sets up future instalments for the franchise, but for Aloy\'s own character arc too. This unfolds primarily through her interactions with Seyka, a soldier of the Quen tribe, who Aloy encounters immediately after reaching the Burning Shores in pursuit of a newly emerged threat. The evolution of their relationship is painted with warmth and wit, culminating in an important moment for Aloy that will no doubt please longtime fans. Ashly Burch\'s consistently endearing performance is complemented well by Kylie Liya Page, too, who endows Seyka with effervescence and charm, but not at the expense of the more nuanced dimensions hiding beneath those outer layers, which gradually unfurl over the course of <em>Burning Shore</em>\'s core questline.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>The expansion also progresses the larger machine war narrative that has been at play since 2017\'s <em><a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/horizon-zero-dawn-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Horizon Zero Dawn</a></em>, although much of this storytelling is beset by the needlessly convoluted sci-fi exposition that the series is known for indulging. Even so, it\'s worth seeing through to the end, if only to appreciate a final, posthumous performance from Lance Reddick, who once again brings his enigmatic magnetism to antihero Sylens. The <em>Horizon</em> franchise will be poorer without him, no doubt, but his presence here is, at least, a bittersweet opportunity for players to say their goodbyes.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Beyond that, the campaign and its surrounding side activities are essentially eight more hours of <em>Forbidden West</em>\'s open-world sightseeing, environmental puzzles, and operatic combat; a familiar cocktail which many fans will happily drink down. The opportunity to enjoy an exclusively new-gen slice of <em>Horizon</em> content is perhaps the most exciting draw here, though, and with its jaw-dropping visuals complemented by a relatively affordable price tag, that spectacle is arguably well worth the cost of admission.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>And while those hoping for a more experimental expansion may come away from <em>Burning Shores</em> feeling a little shortchanged, the more intimate story still offers some nice surprises for Aloy\'s development as a rising PlayStation icon. Guerrilla plays it safe, then, for an enjoyable, if ultimately inessential addendum to last year\'s <em>Horizon</em> sequel. But when that sequel is one of the best PlayStation games of the current generation thus far, it\'s not like we needed many excuses to jump back in anyway.</p>\n</span>', '2024-03-13 05:00:01', '2024-03-13 05:00:01', 'Horizon Forbidden West: Burning Shores Review', 'https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/04/horizon-forbidden-west-burning-shores.jpg?ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=top&auto=format&w=1440&q=80', 'movies', 'https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/horizon-forbidden-west-burning-shores/', 'Platform: PS5 Weve seen Los Angeles plenty of times before in video...', 'gaming');

Whether you\'re focusing on melee or ranged combat, every weapon in <em>Dead Island 2</em> is governed by the game\'s RPG mechanics. Power is determined by item level and what modifications or perks you\'ve applied, so a well-customised combat knife may prove more powerful than an assault rifle.

Released back in 2005 for the GameCube, it not only revolutionised Capcoms horror franchise thanks to a shift towards action, but in adopting an over-the-shoulder view, it helped set the standard that plenty of other games, especially third person shooters, have followed in the years since.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Still, 18 years is a long time in gaming, and while the original  or even its subsequent remasters for later console generations  didnt lack for visual impact, it was long overdue for the full remake treatment. With Capcom having already given classics<em>Resident Evil 2</em>and<em>3</em>a modern overhaul in its stunning RE Engine  originally created for<em>Resident Evil 7</em>and subsequently used for<em>RE Village</em> its finally time to bring<em>Resident Evil 4</em>into line with its fearsome family. But when the original was so revered and influential, for players and the games industry alike, Capcom risks messing with (arguable) perfection.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Thankfully, 2023s<em>Resident Evil 4</em>doesnt disappoint. Leon S Kennedys post-Raccoon City jaunt to Spain in search of the US Presidents kidnapped daughter  only to encounter murderous cults and yet more horrifying bioweapons, this time courtesy of the Las Plagas parasite  is every bit as shocking, compelling, and exciting as before, with the requisite amount of terrifying encounters with chainsaw-wielding madmen and parasite-infested villagers intact.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/03/resident-evil-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/03/resident-evil-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/03/resident-evil-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/03/resident-evil-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/03/resident-evil-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/03/resident-evil-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/03/resident-evil-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>The most striking upgrade is on the visual front, thanks to that powerful RE Engine. Everything looks gorgeous  for a value where gorgeous means absolutely would not want to visit.<em>RE4s</em>settings feel more intimidating than ever, whether dilapidated rural shacks or imposing castles, all benefitting significantly from a 4K HDR glow-up. As is near-standard nowadays, players can opt between resolution or performance modes, but even the most frame rate-focused player should at least briefly check out the game in its full ultra high-def glory. Audio also gets a bump, especially for PS5 players (version tested) where ambient or background sound is pushed out through the DualSense controllers in-built speakers to chilling effect.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>One of the biggest and most welcome alterations Capcom has made is also one of the simplest  the ability to crouch. This minor alteration to controls means stealth is a viable tool in Leons arsenal, often allowing him to sneak past enemies without wasting precious ammo. It changes the tone and feel of some key scenes, and generally for the better. For instance, the early arrival at the village now feels even tenser as you can choose to skulk through back alleys to avoid detection for as long as possible. Along with some new weapons and attacks that allow Leon to silently dispatch enemies, theres more flexibility in how to approach risky sections than ever before.</p>\n</span><div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__ynq1g\" data-test=\"pullquote\">\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__icon__JGpkh\"><span></span></div>\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__content__gRuai\">\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is as close to a definitive edition of the game as it gets.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Another pleasant update is<em>RE4 Remakes</em>approach to Quick Time Events. The 2005 version was notable for these, ostensibly to add a bit of cinematic flair during key encounters, but mostly reducing them to twitchy sections where a mis-timed button press meant failure. Now, Leon can parry attacks with an equipped knife, making those pivotal moments more a matter of skill than luck. The downside is that knives have a durability feature  delivering a stealth kill has next to no impact, but deflecting too many attacks or using the blades to counter enemies that have managed to grab Leon will see them deteriorate rapidly.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Other changes serve to refine what already worked. Leons briefcase, used to store the growing collection of weapons, herbs, and consumables youll scavenge along the way, can now be customised itself. Its not just an aesthetic swap though, as certain changes can increase drop rates of crucial ammo, or improve health recovery rates. Similarly, the fan-favourite merchant, despite some changes to dialogue, now has a side hustle in spinels  originally gems to be swapped for money, theyre now rewards for completing small side quests. Its an odd business model, given that the merchant then trades you rare or one-off items for those same spinels, but who are we to question an otherwise successful entrepreneur?</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Unfortunately, embargo restrictions  and general spoiler decency  prevent discussion of some of the narrative changes Capcom has made, but for the most part the game is stronger for them. Similarly, the odd retooled boss encounter means returning players wont find going through the game again to be a total cake walk.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Is 2023s<em>Resident Evil 4</em>perfect? No, not quite  mainly because the much-loved<em>The Mercenaries</em>mode is absent at launch (though due to arrive via a free update in future), as are the expansion chapters focused on femme fatale Ada Wong (which were in previous re-releases of the original<em>Resident Evil 4</em>, and we can only assume are either being held for future DLC release, or dropped altogether in light of the rejigged continuity of Capcoms_Resi_remakes). Still, this is as close to a efinitive edition of the game as it gets  a nerve-jangling excursion that remains the high point of the whole franchise.</p>\n</span>', '2024-03-13 05:00:01', '2024-03-13 05:00:01', 'Resident Evil 4 (2023) Review', 'https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/03/residnet-evil-1.jpg?ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=top&auto=format&w=1440&q=80', 'movies', 'https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/resident-evil-4-2023/', 'Platforms:PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, PC The originalResident Evil...', 'gaming'),

Set hundreds of years ago, the game sees players guide the young Cereza  Bayonettas real name  through the mysterious Avalon Forest on a quest to save her doomed mother. With barely any magical skills of her own to call on yet, she must rely on her stuffed cat, Cheshire, to survive the dark forces at work in the forest.

Like some of the earliest fairy tales, theres a satisfyingly dark edge to the world, a frisson of danger centred on children being lured into peril and, perhaps, learning hard lessons along the way.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Tapping into Celtic mythology as often as it alludes to works of literary fiction, players will tackle malign fairies and struggle through warped realities as they navigate Avalons twisted depths, only able to restore comparative sanity by completing challenges locked in pocket dimensions called Tr na ngs. Sometimes these will be simple combat trials, where Cereza tangles enemies in vines while Cheshire mauls them. Others present more cerebral puzzles, or environmental obstacles to guide Cereza through while using Cheshire to move equipment. Once a Tr na ng has been completed, the disruption it caused in the real forest is cleared, allowing new areas to be accessed or previously blocked regions to be reached. This, combined with later abilities that activate gates or allow passage through obstacles, add a slight Metroidvania flair to progression and exploration.</p>\n</span><div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__ynq1g\" data-test=\"pullquote\">\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__icon__JGpkh\"><span></span></div>\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__content__gRuai\">\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Its clear that developer PlatinumGames is trying to create some level of synergy between its two primary protagonists, but it never quite works.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Unfortunately, while<em>Bayonetta Origins</em>exudes charm with its visuals, its let down by fiddly mechanics and repetitive design elements. There are essentially three overlapping control schemes, depending on whether Cheshire is carried by Cereza in his plush toy form. Dubbed Hug Mode has Cereza moved by the player, while Cheshire can be stretched out to reach objects using the right thumbstick. With a tap of a button though, Cheshire can shift into his more intimidating demon form, in whats called Unleashed Mode.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>This is where things start getting tricky. In Unleashed mode, players control both characters at once, moving Cereza with the left thumbstick and using her magic with the left shoulder buttons, while Cheshires movement and attacks are governed by the mirrored controls on the right-hand side. For the most part, its simple enough  so long as you keep each character on their respective side of the screen. Should they cross over, which is often necessary during combat, youd better have some spectacularly quick spatial reflexes, as suddenly each character feels as though their controls have inverted.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/03/bayonetta-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/03/bayonetta-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/03/bayonetta-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/03/bayonetta-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/03/bayonetta-1.jpg?auo=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/03/bayonetta-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/03/bayonetta-1.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Its clear that developer PlatinumGames is trying to create some level of synergy between its two primary protagonists, with a control scheme designed to enable controlling both characters at once, but it never quite works. As the pairs abilities are upgraded at rest points, youll discover skills that emphasis switching between Hug and Unleashed mode  for instance, Cerezas magic gauge refills slightly faster when holding Cheshire  but it doesnt entirely come together. After a while, youll likely default to running around as Cereza holding Cheshire in Hug Mode, only unleashing the beast when necessary to get through battles or solve puzzles.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Thankfully, combat is nowhere near as frenzied as in the grown-up<em>Bayonetta</em>games, so youll usually be able to take a breath, move Cereza into position to hold an enemy in place, then move Cheshire to attack. It works, just about, but it lacks the finesse and smoothness fans may expect from the series as a whole, even after accounting for the genre shift. There are still some nods to the skill-oriented gameplay of those core games  Tr na ngs can be replayed from rest areas to improve your time score, for example  but its still a big departure.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>All of which leaves<em>Bayonetta Origins</em>in a limbo as strange as Avalon Forest itself. Its main appeal will be to those already invested in the (surprisingly complex and convoluted) lore of the previous<em>Bayonetta</em>outings, but it offers such a vastly different experience, and at a significantly slower pace, that the end result may grate. Conversely, players who may be won over by its dark charms and more considered pace to exploration will drown in a story that demands at least partial familiarity with the source material. Meanwhile, the muddled combat is unlikely to truly please either camp.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>If you find yourself at the centre of that particular Venn diagram of interests, experience, and expectations,<em>Cereza And The Lost Demon</em>serves as a nice spin-off to<em>Bayonetta</em>prime.

The former skirmishes often take place when rival companies move into the same location, leading to battles layered with a variety of bonus objectives or challenge modifiers to contend with  a smaller number of units, for instance.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"Company Of Heroes 3\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/02/company-of-heroes-3-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/02/company-of-heroes-3-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/02/company-of-heroes-3-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/02/company-of-heroes-3-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/02/company-of-heroes-3-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/02/company-of-heroes-3-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/02/company-of-heroes-3-2.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>The main encounters are typically more fixed, often based around important historical battles, moving the central story along. However, these more goal oriented missions often feel poorly explained to players. Battle objectives may seem to conflict, or need completing in a specific yet unspecified order, while certain major encounters wont even unlock until youve completed particular steps beforehand. None of this is especially clear.</p>\n</span><div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__ynq1g\" data-test=\"pullquote\">\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__icon__JGpkh\"><span></span></div>\n<div class=\"pullQuote_pullquote__content__gRuai\">\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If you can muddle through the busy UI and unclear objectives, Company Of Heroes 3 proves an often thrilling affair.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Actually controlling your forces in battle can become overwhelming too, with an array of overlapping information on screen and too much minutiae to recall on what each unit or facility does, how they move, and what order actions will occur in. Relic tries to mitigate this somewhat  players can enter tactical pause while queuing up commands for their troops, giving as much time as needed to catch their breath, remember what each tool or option does, and issue orders. Hover-text over some (but crucially not all) UI elements can offer reminders of what each aspect does, but the inconsistency here doesnt help.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>If you can muddle through the busy UI and the sometimes unclear objectives though, <em>Company Of Heroes 3</em> proves an often thrilling affair. The story is solid, conveyed through great voice acting (and significantly less-great, barely-animated cutscenes), but Relic brings the real spectacle to its maps. Whether its the sight of soldiers vaulting into cover at the last second or a cacophony of explosions to punctuate important events, battles always feel impressive and high stakes. However, some may find even the maximum aerial zoom isnt zoomed out enough, making for a rather cramped view of the action.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"Company Of Heroes 3\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/02/company-of-heroes-3-3.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/02/company-of-heroes-3-3.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/02/company-of-heroes-3-3.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/02/company-of-heroes-3-3.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/02/company-of-heroes-3-3.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/02/company-of-heroes-3-3.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/02/company-of-heroes-3-3.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Somewhat controversially, <em>Company Of Heroes 3s</em> other campaign mode sees you hopping to the other side of the Mediterranean and controlling the Deutsche Afrika Korps as it tears through Libya. Led by Nazi General Erwin Rommel, who earned the nickname The Desert Fox for his string of victories on the terrain, its a far cry from the heroes of the series title. Relic tries to mitigate the discomfort of playing as Nazis by telling the scenarios story from the perspectiv of the civilians, notably a Jewish family torn apart by the invasion, and highlighting the devastation wrought by the DAK  but its scant comfort when, during the meat of the roughly six-hour campaign, youre guiding a bunch of Nazis throwing banter at each other.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Awkwardly, then, the North African campaign is probably the tighter of the two story modes. Its comparative brevity helps, with only eight linear missions (which also cuts down on the discomfort of, again, <em>playing as the Nazis</em>), but its also more focused. Levels will often have multiple stages to complete, and those stages feel better communicated than in the Italian setting. Meanwhile, leaning more on the factions tanks and vehicles opens up new tactical options, both in terms of raw power and in using those vehicles as cover for ground troops. Relic has created a refined tactical experience here, but even though it tries to dispassionately present the Axis movements in a purely historical view, while highlighting the impact on the communities ransacked as a result, the act of guiding the DAK still feels somewhat lionising of them.</p>\n</span><div class=\"block-item\"><div class=\"lazyLoad\"></div></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Ultimately, <em>Company Of Heroes 3</em> feels more tailored for hardcore fans of the series, or at least of the military tactics genre. Returning players will likely feel right at home with its mixture of territory control and tense skirmishes, but it all feels a bit inaccessible to anyone who hasnt spent the last decade playing the previous entries on repeat.</p>\n</span>', '2024-03-13 05:00:01', '2024-03-13 05:00:01', 'Company Of Heroes 3 Review', 'https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2023/02/company-of-heroes-3-1.jpg?ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=top&auto=format&w=1440&q=80', 'movies', 'https://www.empireonline.com/gaming/reviews/company-of-heroes-3/', 'Platform: PC A decade after Company Of Heroes 2, developer Relic Entertainment...', 'gaming');
